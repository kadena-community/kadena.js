# Kadena & Kadena.js

Kadena was founded on the idea that blockchain could revolutionize how the world interacts and transacts. But to get to mass adoption, chain technology and the ecosystem connecting it to the world needed to be reimagined from the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary chain architecture and created the tools to make blockchain work for everyone. – at speed, scale, and energy efficiency previously thought unachievable.

Our ecosystem powers real-world use cases for enterprises and entrepreneurs, providing the security of Bitcoin, virtually free gas (transaction fees), unparalleled throughput, as well as Pact - a secure smart contract language with built-in bug detection.

With such a revolutionary blockchain the community also needs the tools to create products on this chain. Therefore, we started with Kadena.js. Kadena.js is a Monorepo (mono repository) where we will store all our JavaScript/ TypeScript solutions for our blockchain (libs, tooling, dapps, and so forth).

# Kadena.js

Kadena.js is the source for several packages, tooling, and dapps that have any affiliation with Front-end development.

At this moment Kadena.js will be the home of these packages:

-   `@kadena/cryptography-utils` contains hash/sign utils
-   `@kadena/chainweb-node-client` typed js wrapper with fetch to call chainweb-node API endpoints (amongst others [https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html](https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html)). This will probably have some breakdown
    -   `api` one-to-one mapping of rest endpoints to typed js client
    -   `utils` functions like that use the `api` functions to get information
-   `@kadena/chainweb-data-client` typed js wrapper with fetch to call chainweb-data API endpoints
-   `@kadena/pactjs-client` wrapper around chainweb-node-client with ability to switch environments etc.
-   `@kadena/wallet-client` client for wallet to sign, connect, retrieve account info, etc
-   `@kadena/marmalade-client` specific client for marmalade/NFTs
-   `@kadena/types` common used typescript definitions. Preferably this will all move to the low-level libraries. Whenever you build something on top of those, you can use those types.
-   =====
-   `@kadena/pactjs` runtime for generating pact expressions
-   `@kadena/pactjs-cli` cli to generate pact contract type definitions and interface to pact client. deployment of contracts, etc
-   `@kadena/pactjs-generator` library that creates typescript definition from contract, template, etc
-   `.kadena/pactjs-generated` library that does not exist on npm. It is _generated_ by `@kadena/pactjs-cli` and `@kadena/pactjs-generator` and is a dependency of `@kadena/pactjs`
-   `@kadena/transaction-templates` a supportive library for transactions. As there is no way to determine from pact alone which caps are needed for a given transaction, and in turn which signatures are needed, we want to provide the community a way to "publish" templates. These templates can be used by `@kadena/pactjs-cli` to generate the necessary typescript definitions

As our ecosystem will grow so will the packages and dapps we will release under Kadena.js.

# Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md on how to contribute.

## Getting started

See [requirements](#requirements) to get started. After that come back here

- run `rush install` when you've cloned the project
- adding dependencies is done
  - with `rush add -p <package>` (add `--dev` if needed)
  - by adding it to the `package.json` and running `rush update` afterwards

If any issues occur, you can run `rush update --purge`

## Requirements

- node 16
- rushjs

See [installing perequisites](#installing-prerequisites)

## Installing prerequisites

### Install `node`

several options, here used `n`. Can also use `asdf` (generic version manager),
`nvm`, or installation with `brew` (discouraged)

```sh
# `n` node version manager
brew install n
n 16
```

### Install `rush`

```sh
pnpm install --global @microsoft/rush
```
