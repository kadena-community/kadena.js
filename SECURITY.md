# Security

If you become aware of an exploit or vulnerability anywhere in the Kadena system
— either Chainweb, Pact or our websites — we would appreciate hearing about it
through our bug bounty program. After creating an account there, please provide
the results of your research so we can analyze it to determine the level of
severity it represents. Depending on that degree, we offer different payout
levels as described on our project page at
[https://immunefi.com/bounty/kadena][1].
