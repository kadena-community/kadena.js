# Use ADRs

Status: accepted

## Context

Sometimes we have requirements or make decisions in our architecture that
deserve to be recorded properly. This is a format to do this. It also motivates
to add more background information such as reasoning and considered alternatives
(which isn't always appropriate or interesting in regular documentation).

## Decision

Record decisions in this repository using [the template][1].

## Consequences

We, our collaborators and our successors will have a better understanding of why
things are the way they are, and make better decisions as a consequence.
