# Supported Environments

Date: 2023-06-13

Status: proposed

## Context

The tools and code **in this monorepo** run on various operating systems and
environments, including Node.js and browsers.

It's not feasible to support every operating system and every version of every
browser on the planet. To keep a sustainable pace of development without
spending an irrational amount of efforts spent in fixing bugs or developing
features in environments only a small amount of people are using, this section
contains an overview of environments we fully test and support.

This decision does not cover:

- other repositories
- IDEs
- internal tooling such as Node.js

## Decision

This section contains an overview of environments we fully test and support.

### Developer machines

We support Linux and macOS environments, this includes Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL).

We do not support other shells in Windows such as PowerShell or Git Bash. It may
work, but bugs or feature requests will have low priority.

### GitHub Actions

We run tests in GitHub Actions. We run tests in `ubuntu-latest`, since that
covers most use cases and is fast. It's also the most-used distro for WSL.

### Browsers

The documentation website, tools and tutorials should work in the **latest two
versions** of all major browsers:

- Brave
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Firefox
- Apple Safari + iOS Safari

## Consequences

Windows users may need to install WSL for development and to run tests.

Developers may be excluded from using our services or contributing to our
codebase when they're using unsupported environments or browsers.
