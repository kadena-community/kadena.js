# Linting & Formatting

## Separation of Concerns

Linting and formatting has been separated in this monorepo. Here are two
resources that explain why:

- [ESLint is deprecating formatting rules][1]
- [What About Formatting?][2]
- [Formatters, linters, and compilers: Oh my!][3] says:

> Don't use linters for formatting!
>
> Although lint rules can enforce some formatting preferences in code, they're
> slower, less consistent, and more prone to missing edge cases when compared to
> dedicated formatters.

Another reason is that it should be possible to replace either ESLint or
Prettier without them being too intermingled.

This separation of concerns leads to clearer objectives and faster execution.
For example, if you want to know whether your code is formatted properly you can
do `pnpm lint` and get your answer faster compared to doing everything at once.

With that in mind, this document describes some main aspects of the current
setup.

## Prettier inside ESLint

What about `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`?

Confusingly perhaps, `eslint-plugin-prettier` loads and runs Prettier inside
ESLint, while `eslint-config-prettier` disables rules from core and other
plugins. The latter is what we want and the direction ESLint itself is going.

That's why we've removed `eslint-plugin-prettier`, and include only
`eslint-config-prettier`.

## Scripts

_tl/dr; Use `pnpm format` for formatting and `pnpm lint` for linting._

When looking into the related scripts in `package.json` you'll find something
like this:

```json
{
  "name": "@kadena/pkg",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "pnpm run --sequential /^format:.*/",
    "format:lint": "pnpm run lint:src --fix",
    "format:md": "remark README.md -o --use @kadena-dev/markdown",
    "format:src": "prettier . --cache --write",
    "lint": "pnpm run /^lint:.*/",
    "lint:fmt": "prettier . --cache --check",
    "lint:pkg": "lint-package",
    "lint:src": "eslint src --ext .js,.ts,.jsx,.tsx,.mjs"
  }
}
```

This might seem confusing or mixed up at first. Naming is hard! The naming of
the scripts here is mainly based on the fact that ESLint and Prettier do both
formatting and linting:

- The `format:lint` script means "format using the linting rules" (using
  `eslint --fix`)
- The `lint:fmt` script means "lint the formatting" (using `prettier --check`)

Note that formatting should happen sequentially to prevent , and Prettier should
have the last word here.

The `format:src` and `lint:src` are the usual suspects here. The common `format`
and `lint` scripts are reserved for convenience and run multiple other scripts,
as we have more formatting and linting solutions.

## Future

As long as `eslint --fix` formats code that Prettier doesn't, ESLint can't be
ditched for formatting. Prettier does have plugins that extends its formatting
capabilities. We're already using `prettier-plugin-packagejson`. It's good to
keep moving into this direction and stay away from ESLint for formatting
whenever possible.
