## Code of Conduct 


## Kadena & Kadena.js

Kadena was founded on the idea that blockchain could revolutionize how the world interacts and transacts. 
But to get to mass adoption, chain technology and the ecosystem connecting it to the world needed 
to be reimagined from the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary chain architecture and created the 
tools to make blockchain work for everyone. â€“ at speed, scale, and energy efficiency previously thought unachievable.

Our ecosystem powers real-world use cases for enterprises and entrepreneurs, providing the security of Bitcoin, 
virtually free gas (transaction fees), unparalleled throughput, as well as Pact - a secure smart contract 
language with built-in bug detection.

With such a revolutionary blockchain the community also needs the tools to create products on this chain. 
Therefore, we started with Kadena.js.
Kadena.js is a Monorepo (mono repository) where we will store all our JavaScript/ TypeScript solutions for 
our blockchain (libs, tooling, dapps, and so forth).


## Kadena.js and Packages
Kadena.js is the source for several packages, tooling and dapps that have any affiliation with Front-end development.

At this moment Kadena.js will be the home of these packages:
* @kadena/cryptography-utils contains encode/decode/hash utils
* @kadena/chainweb-node-client typed js wrapper with fetch to call chainweb-node API endpoints (amongst others https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html).
This will probably have some breakdown
  * api one-to-one mapping of rest endpoints to typed js client
  * utils functions like that use the api functions to get information
* @kadena/chainweb-data-client typed js wrapper with fetch to call chainweb-data API endpoints
* @kadena/pactjs-core low-level generator for pact expressions
* @kadena/pactjs-cli cli to generate pact contract type definitions and interface to pact client. deployment of contracts, etc
* @kadena/pactjs-client wrapper around chainweb-node-client with ability to switch environments etc.
* @kadena/wallet-client client for wallet to sign, connect, retreive account info, etc
* @kadena/marmalade-client specific client for marmalade/NFTs

As our eco system will grow so will the packages and dapps we will release under Kadena.js.

### Conventions
tbd.
