# Decentralized exchange (DEX) integration guide

This guide provides a quick reference for how to perform the most common tasks when an exchange or a similar application needs to interact with the Kadena blockchain.
The information is this guide is similar to topics covered elsewhere in the documentation.
For example, you can see similar information in the following topics:

- [Common task quick reference](/guides/howto-quick-ref)
- [Create new accounts](/guides/accounts/howto-create-accounts)
- [Check account balances](/guides/accounts/howto-get-balances)
- [Sign and submit transactions](/guides/transactions/howto-sign-submit-tx)

However, this guide assumes that you are operating an exchange and need to interact with the Kadena blockchain programmatically using scripts and, potentially, automation.

This guide also assumes the following:

- You host one or more Chainweb nodes that you control and monitor.
- You have one or more Chainweb nodes that connect to the Kadena test network or main production network.
- You want to use the Kadena client libraries to write scripts that perform common tasks, like creating transactions and listening for events.

This guide includes code examples written in TypeScript for all of the common exchange-related activity.
If you aren't already hosting your own Chainweb node, see [Get started running a node](/guides/nodes/howto-node-operator) for an introduction to setting up a Chainweb node.

## Connect to specific chains

You can interact with the Kadena network through any of its separate chains.
The chains—with chain identifiers 0 through 19—share a common view of state, but operate independently and in parallel.

Because the chains operate independently and you must specify the chain identifier that you want to send transactions to, most exchanges limit the number of chains they work with.

If you want to limit the chains you work with, you can write a custom **host generator** function to connect to specific chains.
The following example illustrates creating a Kadena **client** connection that only connects to chains 0, 1, and 2:

```typescript
// Import the createClient function from the library.
import { createClient } from '@kadena/client';

// Generally, exchanges host their own nodes and
// only interact with a limited set of chains.
const customHostGeneratorFunction = ({ networkId, chainId }) => {
  if (![0, 1, 2].includes(chainId)) {
    throw new Error('Exchange only conducts business on chains 0, 1, and 2.');
  }

  const hostname = 'kadena-node.my-exchange.tld';
  return `https://${hostname}/chainweb/0.0/${networkId}/chain/${chainId}/pact`;
};

// This call creates a client that can connect to the blockchain.
const client = createClient(customHostGeneratorFunction, {
  // Exchanges typically wait for more blocks to be confirmed by consensus.
  confirmationDepth: 10, 
});
```

If you haven't already downloaded and installed the `@kadena/client` libraries, see [Get started with Kadena client](/reference/kadena-client#get-started-with-kadena-client) for an introduction to creating and using client connections to interact with Chainweb nodes and the Kadena blockchain.
You should also download and install the helper utilities defined in the `@kadena/client-utils` library.
This library provides simplified functions for interacting with the Kadena `coin` contract and developing your own custom interfaces.
For more information about the helper utilities, see the [client-utils](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/client-utils) repository and [@kadena/client-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadena/client-utils) package registry.

## Generate an account on the blockchain

For exchanges, the recommended best practice is to use a **multi-signature account** to manage the funds that are owned by the exchange. 
With a multi-signature account, you can apply the **four-eyes** principle to require transactions to be approved by at least two people.

The four-eyes principle, sometimes referred to as the two-person rule, is a broadly-accepted security method that ensures certain activities—such as the transfer of assets—are approved by at least two authorized individuals. 
Exchanges can apply this principle to prevent errors, fraud, or malicious behavior using the built-in
predicates for multi-signature accounts:

- `keys-all` requires all authorized account keys to sign every transaction.
- `keys-2` requires at least two of any number of authorized account keys to sign every transaction.
- `keys-any` requires that any single authorized account key signs every transaction.

Typically, exchanges use the `keys-2` predicate for the account that manages funds owned by the exchange and two or more authorized account keys.

You can create a multi-signature account and associated keys by using any wallet that supports the Kadena network and native KDA currency.
For example, you can create keys and accounts by using any of the following wallets:

- [Chainweaver v3](https://wallet.kadena.io) (built by Kadena).
  You can also import accounts and keys from previous versions of Chainweaver.

- [Kadena CLI Wallet](https://docs.kadena.io/reference/cli/cli-wallet) (built by Kadena).
  You can also use `@kadena/kadena-cli` to import accounts and keys from previous versions of Chainweaver, from other wallets, or from public and private key pairs you've generated using other tools.

- [Other Kadena ecosystem wallets](https://www.kadena.io/defi/wallets?topic=Wallets).
  You can also create an account using any of the wallets developed by third parties that support the Kadena network.

### Using Chainweaver

1. Open [Chainweaver v3](https://wallet.kadena.io) and click **Add new profile** to create a wallet or **Recover your wallet** to import information from a backup file or recovery phrase.
   
   If creating a new wallet, type a **Profile name** and select a security method.
   If recovering a wallet, provide the backup file or recovery phase to import keys and accounts.
   
   After creating or importing the wallet, the list of your assets on the Kadena **Mainnet** network is displayed by default.
   You can change the current network to **Testnet** or add another network by clicking **Settings**.
   
   ![Chainweaver network selection](/img/chainweaver-your-assets.jpg)

2. Click **+ Account**, then select **Create Multi-Sig**.
3. Type an account alias name, select or enter the public keys for the account and a predicate, then click **Create account**.
   
   ![Select the keys and predicate for the account](/img/multi-sig-account.png)

4. Verify the new account is listed with a `w:` prefix in the list of assets.
   
   ![Multi-signature account](/img/w-multi-sig.jpg)

   Note that the account has no funds.
   At this point, the account isn't associated with any of the chains in the network.
   You must add funds on at least one specific chain in the network  you've selected for the account to become active and available for use.
   
   If you are setting up this multi-signature account on the Testnet network, you can fund the account directly from Chainweaver or by using the [Developer Tools](tools.kadena.io) Testnet faucet.

5. Click the multi-signature account alias to view its details, then click **Fund on Testnet** to fund the account.
   
   After the transaction is mined into a block, you can click **Chain Distribution** to see the chain that received funds on the Testnet network.
   If needed, you can transfer funds to your account on another chain.

   If you're funding an account on the Mainnet network, you must acquire funds through another exchange.

### Using mnemonic phrases

To use mnemonic phrases programmatically, you can use the [`@kadena/hd-wallet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadena/hd-wallet) library.

### Using client utilities

The following example demonstrates how to create a Kadena account with two public keys and the `keys-2` predicate requiring both signatures to sign transaction on the Kadena main network and chain 0:

```typescript
import { createAccount } from '@kadena/client-utils/coin';

const result = await createAccount(
  {
    account: 'k:' + publicKey,
    keyset: {
      pred: 'keys-2',
      keys: [publicKeyA, publicKeyB], // two public keys for a 2-of-2 multisig
      // keys: [publicKeyA, publicKeyB, publicKeyC], // three public keys for a 2-of-3 multisig
    },
    gasPayer: { account: 'gasPayer', publicKeys: [''] },
    chainId: '0',
  },
  {
    host: customHostGeneratorFunction,
    defaults: {
      networkId: 'mainnet01',
    },
    sign: signWithChainweaver,
  },
)
  // signed Tx
  .on('sign', (data) => console.log(data))
  // preflight result
  .on('preflight', (data) => console.log(data))
  // submit result
  .on('submit', (data) => console.log(data))
  // listen result
  .on('listen', (data) => console.log(data))
  .execute();
```

## Retrieve balances

The following example illustrates using the `getBalance` function from the `@kadena/client-utils` library:

```typescript
import { getBalance } from '@kadena/client-utils/coin';

const balance = await getBalance(
  'k:my-wallet-address',
  'mainnet01',
  '0', // chainId
  customHostGeneratorFunction, // You can pass the hostname or a generator function.
);
console.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);
```

## Create, sign, and send a transaction

To create a transaction manually, you can combine the `Pact.builder` and `Pact.modules` functions:

- `Pact.builder` to create an unsigned transaction request to execute in the transaction request.
- `Pact.modules.<module>.<function>` to create a Pact expression.

The following example demonstrates how create, sign, and send a `transfer` transaction manually using the `@kadena/client` library:

```typescript
async function transfer(
  sender: string,
  senderAPublicKey: string,
  senderBPublicKey: string,
  receiver: string,
  amount: IPactDecimal,
): Promise<void> {
  const transaction = Pact.builder
    .execution(
      // pact expression
      Pact.modules.coin.transfer(sender, receiver, amount),
    )
    // add signers
    .addSigner(senderAPublicKey, (signFor) => [
      // add capabilities
      signFor('coin.GAS'),
      signFor('coin.TRANSFER', sender, receiver, amount),
    ])
    // if second signer is needed due to `keys-2` predicate on the `sender` account
    .addSigner(senderBPublicKey, (signFor) => [
      signFor('coin.TRANSFER', sender, receiver, amount),
    ])
    // set chainId and sender
    .setMeta({ chainId: '0', senderAccount: sender })
    .setNetworkId('mainnet01')
    // will create a IUnsignedTransaction { cmd, hash, sigs }
    .createTransaction();

  const signedTx = await signWithChainweaver(transaction);

  // create client
  const client = createClient(customHostGeneratorFunction, {
    confirmationDepth: 10,
  });

  // check if all necessary signatures are added
  if (isSignedTransaction(signedTx)) {
    const transactionDescriptor = await client.submit(signedTx);
    const response = await client.listen(transactionDescriptor, {});
    if (response.result.status === 'failure') {
      throw response.result.error;
    } else {
      console.log(response.result);
    }
  }
}

// run the function
transfer(senderAccount, senderPublicKey, receiverAccount, {
  decimal: '13.37',
}).catch(console.error);
```

## Check the status of a transaction

There are two primary ways to check the status of a transaction programmatically:

- You can check the status of a single transaction by passing the `requestKey` hash for the transaction when calling the `getStatus` function.
- You can poll for the status of one or more transactions until the transaction request returned a result.

### Single check

```typescript
const client = createClient(/* omitted options, see "Low Level Client"*/);
// requestKey is the hash of the submitted transaction
client.getStatus({ chainId, networkId, requestKey });
```

### Polling check

```typescript
client.pollStatus(
  { networkId: 'mainnet01', chainId: '0', requestKey: 'tx-hash' },
  { confirmationDepth: 10 },
);
```

## Estimate gas usage

To get an estimation of the gas usage, you can execute a `local` call.

Note that the gas estimation can be different from the actual gas by a transaction when the transaction is executed on the blockchain. 
State changes that are recorded on the blockchain can influence the branches the code takes to keep included in a block.

```typescript
// We do not need to send signatures to check gas estimation.
// However, signatures can influence the direction of the code, thus gas usage.
const response = await client.local(unsignedTx, {
  preflight: true,
  signatureVerification: false,
});

if (response.result.status === 'failure') {
  throw response.result.error;
}

const gasEstimation = response.gas;
```

## Listens for events

There are several ways you can listen for events emitted by transactions that are executed on the blockchain.
For example, you can listen for `coin.TRANSFER` events in the following ways:

- Use the [`chainweb-stream`](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-stream) server package with the
[`@kadena/chainweb-stream-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadena/chainweb-stream-client) to listen for specific events.

- Use third-party indexing services such as [Kadindexer](https://www.kadindexer.io/) or [Tatum](https://www.tatum.io/) to listen for specific events.

- Implement a custom listener using the [`@kadena/chainwebjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadena/chainwebjs)
package.
