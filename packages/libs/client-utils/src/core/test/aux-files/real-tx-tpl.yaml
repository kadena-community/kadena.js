# A Kadena gas station is nothing more than a KDA account controlled by a
# special guard. This transaction template constructs gas station
# safely...i.e. it calls rotate after creating the account to ensure that you
# will be able to rotate it's guard in the future if any of the gas station's
# limits need to be changed. The mk-guard lambda function makes the important
# parts of the guard DRY to minimize the chance of mistakes.
