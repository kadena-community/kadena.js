## Conventions

### Component Structure

Component.Root etc.

- avoiding external elements (current exception is Next/Link)
- Composition vs configuration

### Component Property Naming Convention

### Standards regarding storybook and when we should write unit tests

### File structure and naming naming conventions

- always having a barrel file
- CSS files should be named after the component

### Exports

- we always export component props
- never export default

### Type naming convention

- use interface for props and any objects (there are exceptions) - naming
  convention is to always prefix with I (for interface) and props always have a
  prop suffix
- use types for others
