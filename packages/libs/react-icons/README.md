# React Icons

Design system icons generated for react using svgr

## Getting Started

Icons have been created from the design system repository with the following considerations:

1. The default fill color is set to `currentColor`.
2. The dimensions for width and height are established at `1em`, while the default `fontSize` is `1.5em`.
3. These icons are compiled into a distinct package, which is designed without knowledge of the design tokens. This approach ensures that properties such as fill and fontSize remain generic, eliminating circular dependencies between the `@kadena/react-ui` and allowing the icons to be universally compatible with any build-system and react styling solutions.
4. Icons are grouped in different folders and package entries eg `@kadena/react-icons/system`.

### Install

```sh
pnpm install @kadena/react-icons
```

### Development

All icons are autogenerated from this [file](https://github.com/kadena-community/design-system/blob/main/tokens/foundation/icon/svg.tokens.json) in the design system repo.

- `pnpm generate:icons` run `script/generateIcons.ts` to generate icon components inside the `src` folder
- `pnpm build` to build the `src` folder for publishing
