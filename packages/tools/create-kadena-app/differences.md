## 🔍 How Our Scaffold Differs from `create-kadena-app`

While Kadena already provides [`create-kadena-app`](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/blob/main/packages/tools/create-kadena-app), our scaffold project takes a slightly different approach. Here’s a breakdown:

| Feature                    | `create-kadena-app`                                                   | Our Scaffold                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal**           | Bootstraps a Next.js frontend integrated with Kadena wallet & APIs    | Provides a minimal **developer-first playground** to quickly write, deploy, and test Pact contracts                        |
| **Ease of Use**            | Contract predeployed on testnet                                       | Best for developers exploring **Pact contracts** and learning Kadena’s,also contains a contract out of the box for testing |
| **Smart Contract Support** | No direct contract deployment flow                                    | Provides tooling to **deploy Pact contracts locally** and interact through a simple UI                                     |
| **Learning Curve**         | Great if you already know Next.js and want Kadena features plugged in | Great if you want to **understand Pact, namespaces, and keysets** before moving to production                              |

## 🚀 Why Our Scaffold Stands Out

With features such as **deploying custom Pact contracts** and the ability to **interact with them directly through the frontend**,  
the new scaffold app acts as a **“SpeedrunEthereum” for Kadena**.

It’s designed to help developers go from **zero to smart contract interaction** in minutes —  
perfect for learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping.
