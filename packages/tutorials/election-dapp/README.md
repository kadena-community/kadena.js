# Election dApp tutorial

This repository contains the code files used in the [Election dApp tutorial](https://github.com/kadena-community/docs/blob/master/guides/building-a-voting-dapp.md).

## Repository structure

The repository is broken down into the following directories:

* `pact`, which holds the smart contracts
* `front-end`, which holds a basic react application which forms the front-end part of our application
* `snippets`, which holds code snippets to facilitate deployment of our smart contracts to testnet and mainnet

See the tutorial for a detailed description on the contents of each of these folders.
