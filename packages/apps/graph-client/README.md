This is a [Next.js][1] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`][2].

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000][3] with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes][4] can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello][5]. This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes][4] instead of React pages.

# GraphQL

To get autocompletion on GraphQL you need

- VSCode extension [`GraphQL.vscode-graphql`][6]
