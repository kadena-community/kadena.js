# Getting started

First, install dependencies and build up to and including `@kadena/graph`.

```sh
pnpm install --filter @kadena/graph...
pnpm turbo build --filter @kadena/graph...
```

> **NOTE:** you need Docker (or an alternative, e.g.
> [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)) to be installed

1. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Start devnet:

   > **NOTE:** This project has a built-in command to create and start devnet.
   > For the full guide visit the quickstart page on the documentation website
   > [here](https://docs.kadena.io/build/quickstart).

   ```sh
   pnpm run devnet
   ```

   This command will start the existing image, and if not found, download and
   run a new image.

   You can run `pnpm run devnet:update` to update the devnet image.

   In case you always want to get the latest image, you can force docker to pull
   the image by adding `--pull=always` after `docker run` in the `devnet`
   script.

   If something goes wrong, you can delete the volume, and try to start again:

   ```sh
   docker volume rm kadena_devnet
   ```

   > **Windows alternative**  
   > Replace `$HOME` with `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` in the `devnet` script. If you
   > get an error try not mounting the volume by removing the following part:
   > `-v <arg>`

3. Start the project

   ```sh
   pnpm run start
   ```

4. Go to localhost:4000/graphql and execute this query to see if everything
   works

   ```gql
   subscription {
     newBlocks {
       chainId
       hash
       height
     }
   }
   ```

## Useful extra's

### Connect to the database

You can use Prisma's built in Studio as a database GUI, using
`pnpm run prisma:studio`, or you can connect to the database using `psql`.

You need to have `psql` installed
([How to Install psql on Mac, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows](https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows/))

```sh
psql -h localhost -U devnet
```

### Fund an account on the devnet

```sh
pnpm run fund -- -k <key> -a <amount>
```

- key - public key to fund (default: will generate a new account)
- amount - amount to be funded (default: 100)

### Simulate traffic on the devnet

The simulation uses a seeded random number generator. This means each simulation
is possible to replicate in the exact same order and with the exact same
amounts, given that the inputs stay the same. Note: the created account keys and
request keys of the transactions will not stay the same. When a simulation
starts, some information regarding the transactions is saved on a file. This
file can be found on `packages/apps/graph/src/scripts/devnet/logs`. The filename
is determined by `timestamp` and `seed`.

Advanced: In each iteration a new random number is generated, so that the
transactions are different, with different amounts and to and from different
chains. The new number is generated using the previous one as seed.

#### Coin simulation

In the coin simulation, fungibles are transfered between accounts at a random
order. The simulation is also responsible for creating differents transactions
types such as transfers, cross-chain transfers, and safe transfers.

```sh
pnpm run simulate:coin -a <numberOfAccounts> -i <timeInterval> -t <maxAmount> -tp <tokenPool> -s <seed>
```

- numberOfAccounts - number of accounts to be created in the devnet (default: 6)
- timeInterval - frequency of transactions in miliseconds (default: 100)
- maxAmount - maximum amount for a single transaction (default: 25)
- tokenPool - amount of circulating tokens (default: 1000000)
- seed - seed for random number generation (default: current timestamp)

#### Marmalade simulation

In the marmalade simulation, non-fungibles tokens are created, minted and
transfered between accounts at a random order. The simulation is also
responsible for creating differents tokens along its course.

```sh
pnpm run simulate:marmalade -a <numberOfAccounts> -i <timeInterval> -mt <maximumMintValue> -s <seed>
```

- numberOfAccounts - number of accounts to be created in the devnet (default: 8)
- timeInterval - frequency of transactions in miliseconds (default: 100)
- maximumMintValue - maximum amount a token can be minted at once (default: 25)
- seed - seed for random number generation (default: current timestamp)

#### Flood devnet

In the flood command we are able to flood the network with transactions. We can
alter the configuration via the parameters.

```sh
pnpm run simulate:flood -tx <transactions> -i <interval> -t <totalTx>
```

- transactions - amount of transactions per iteration
- interval - time interval between iterations
- totalTx - total number of transactions before command stops

### Tracing and trace analysis

To enable tracing, set the `TRACING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` in
the `.env` file. This will enable tracing for all GraphQL queries and mutations
and log them to `traces.log` (by default) in the root directory. You can also
configure the output name of the log file by setting the `TRACING_LOG_FILENAME`
environment variable.

After letting the server run and collect trace data, you can then run the trace
analysis script to get statistics of the traces:

```sh
pnpm run trace:analyse -s <sort> -l <limit>
```

- sort - sort by a field (default: `median`)
- limit - limit the number of queries to output (default: no limit)

### Query Complexity

To enable query complexity limits and calculations, set `COMPLEXITY_ENABLED` to
`true`. The complexity limit, which determines how complex queries are allowed
to be, can be set with `COMPLEXITY_LIMIT`. You can expose the complexity of a
query by setting `COMPLEXITY_EXPOSED` to `true`, which returns the complexity
details in the `extensions` section of the response.

The overal query complexity is calculated by combining the field complexity, the
depth and the breath. The complexity of the fields is determined by the
following rules:

- Fields that do not make external calls: 1
- Calls to Chainweb Node: 7
- Prisma calls without relations: 5
- Prisma calls with relations: 10
- \*In cases of lists, a multiplier is applied for the requested item count.

### Gas Limit Estimations

You can get the gas limit estimation for any transaction by using the `gasLimitEstimate` query. The input accepts a JSON object and based on the parameters passed it will determine what type of format it is and return the gas limit estimation. The following types are supported:

- `full-transaction`: A complete transaction object. Required parameters: `cmd`, `hash` and `sigs`.
- `stringified-command`: A JSON stringified command. Required parameters: `cmd`. It also optionally accepts `sigs`.
- `full-command`: A full command. Required parameters: `payload`, `meta` and `signers`.
- `partial-command`: A partial command. Required parameters: `payload` and either `meta` or `signers`. In case `meta` is not given, but `signers` is given, you can also add `chainId` as a parameter.
- `payload`: A just the payload of a command. Required parameters: `payload` and `chainId`.
- `code`: The code of an execution. Required parameters: `code` and `chainId`.

Every type accepts an optional parameter called `networkId` to override the default value from the environment variables.

### Prisma JSON field queries

Some columns in the database are of type `jsonb`. To query these columns, you can supply a stringified JSON object that matches the [JSON object property filters](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/working-with-json-fields#filter-on-object-property) from Prisma.

An example of such a filter parameter value could be: `{ params: "{\"array_starts_with\": \"k:97636f47cede6f22f78e2b5ad9e50d11e4e805d414be40b87d3e2cf781998f27\"}" }`, in which case, the `params` column is a `jsonb` type column which is filtered to only include rows where the value contains an array that has the string `k:97636f47cede6f22f78e2b5ad9e50d11e4e805d414be40b87d3e2cf781998f27` on index 0.

Queries that allow such filters:

- `parametersFilter` on the `events` query and `events` subscription.
