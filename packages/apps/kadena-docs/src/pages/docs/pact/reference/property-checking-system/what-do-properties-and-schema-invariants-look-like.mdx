          ## What do properties and schema invariants look like?

Here's an example of Pact's properties in action -- we declare a property
alongside the docstring of the function to which it corresponds. Note that the
function delegates its implementation of keyset enforcement to another function,
`enforce-admin`, and we don't need to be concerned about its internal details.
Our property states that if the transaction submitted to the blockchain runs
successfully, it must be the case that the transaction has the proper signatures
to satisfy the keyset named `admins`:

```lisp
(defun read-account (id)
  @doc   "Read data for account ID"
  @model [(property (authorized-by 'admins))]

  (enforce-admin)
  (read 'accounts id ['balance 'ccy 'amount]))
```

There's a set of square brackets around our property because Pact allows
multiple properties to be defined simultaneously:

```lisp
[p1 p2 p3 ...]
```

Next, we see an example of schema invariants. For any table with the following
schema, if our property checker succeeds, we know that all possible code paths
will always maintain the invariant that token balances are greater than zero:

```lisp
(defschema tokens
  @doc   "token schema"
  @model [(invariant (> balance 0))]

  username:string
  balance:integer)
```
