    ## SPV

### verify-spv

_type_&nbsp;`string` _payload_&nbsp;`object:&lt;in&gt;`
_&rarr;_&nbsp;`object:&lt;out&gt;`

Performs a platform-specific spv proof of type TYPE on PAYLOAD. The format of
the PAYLOAD object depends on TYPE, as does the format of the return object.
Platforms such as Chainweb will document the specific payload types and return
values.

```lisp
(verify-spv "TXOUT" (read-msg "proof"))
```
