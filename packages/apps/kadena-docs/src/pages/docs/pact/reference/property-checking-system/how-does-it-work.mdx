          ## How does it work?

Pact's property checker works by realizing the language's semantics in an SMT
("Satisfiability Modulo Theories") solver -- by building a formula for a
program, and testing the validity of that formula. The SMT solver can prove that
there is no possible assignment of values to variables which can falsify a
provided proposition about some Pact code. Pact currently uses Microsoft's
[Z3 theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki) to power its property
checking system.

Such a formula is built from the combination of the functions in a Pact module,
the properties provided for those functions, and invariants declared on schemas
in the module.

For any function definition in a Pact module, any subsequent call to another
function is inlined. Before any properties are tested, this inlined code must
pass typechecking.

For schema invariants, the property checker takes an inductive approach: it
assumes that the schema invariants _hold_ for the data currently in the
database, and _checks_ that all functions in the module maintain those
invariants for any possible DB modification.
