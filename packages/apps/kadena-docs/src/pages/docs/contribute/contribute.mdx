The Kadena documentation is open source and hosted on GitHub. Using our
public-facing [Docs](https://github.com/kadena-community/docs) repo in the
[Kadena Community GitHub](https://github.com/kadena-community), you can make
suggested changes using pull requests. This allows community members to improve
the documentation and helps improve the Kadena developer experience.

There are 3 ways to contribute to the Docs depending on where you are starting
from.

- From the Docs
- From GitHub
- From a Local Environment.

This article goes over each of these options to help you suggest changes to the
[Kadena Docs](https://github.com/kadena-community/docs).
