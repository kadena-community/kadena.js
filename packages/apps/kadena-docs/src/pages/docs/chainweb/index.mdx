[API of chainweb-node](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node)

Chainweb is a scalable Proof-Of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. It is an
conservative extension of Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus that extends Bitcoin's
single chain algorithm to multiple chains. This allows for unlimited transaction
throughput by horizontally scaling the number of chains.
