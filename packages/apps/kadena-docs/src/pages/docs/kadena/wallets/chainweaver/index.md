encountered issues installing the .ova

:::

#### Create a new wallet or restore an existing wallet

![create-a-new](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/create-a-new.png)

**Create a new wallet**

Three main steps; (1) set password, (2) record recovery phrase, (3) verify
recovery phrase

1. ​Set password: Create a strong, secret, and unique password. See the Basic
   Safety Tips section for suggestions on password generation.
2. Record recovery phrase: Mouse over each of the 12 words to view and record
   your recovery phrase. See the Basic Safety Tips section for suggestions on
   securing your recovery phrase.
3. Verify recovery phrase: Enter each word in the correct order to verify that
   you have correctly recorded your recovery phrase.

**Restore existing wallet from recovery phrase**

Three main steps; (1) enter recovery phrase, (2) set new password, (3)
re-generate keys

1. Enter recovery phrase: Follow the guidance to enter your 12-word recovery
   phrase.
2. Set new password: Input a new password for your existing wallet.
3. Re-generate keys: From the Keys section, select the Generate Key button to
   restore keys. These keys are deterministically generated meaning that the
   same keys will always appear in the same order by using the recovery phrase
   as a master seed. Repeat selecting the Generate Key button until all
   necessary keys are restored.

**Restore existing wallet from wallet export**

Two main steps; (1) select file, (2) enter password

1. Select a properly formatted file to import
2. Enter the password for the chosen wallet file

:::note

Importing a wallet file will replace the data within the current wallet.

:::

## Interface overview

![interface-overview](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/interface-overview.png)

​Chainweaver's interface consists of three main elements; (1) Network Display,
(2) Sections Menu, (3) Main Viewer

**Network Display (top bar)** This display bar persists across all screen views
within Chainweaver so that you will always know the network with which you are
interacting

**Sections Menu (left bar)** Use this menu to go to different Sections

- Accounts: Display of all added accounts and their status across chains.
  Deposit and withdraw KDA.
- Keys: Display of all public keys generated within the wallet
- Contracts: Write, deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Resources: Reference helpful support materials
- Settings: Configure wallet and network settings
- Logout: Log out of the desktop application

**Main Viewer (center screen)** This is where you interact with the section you
have chosen from the Sections Menu.

#### Update to the latest version of Chainweaver

Upgrading Chainweaver is an essential part of keeping your crypto assets safe
and enjoying new features for interacting with the Kadena blockchain ecosystem.
The latest version of Chainweaver will always be available for download at
[https://www.kadena.io/chainweaver](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/%E2%80%9Chttps://www.kadena.io/chainweaver%22).

:::note

Ensure you have a secure connection before downloading any applications. Most
issues can be resolved simply by updating to the latest version of Chainweaver.

:::

## Networks

### Different networks in Chainweaver

Chainweaver allows you to interact with different networks, including the main
network (“Mainnet”) and a test network (“Testnet”)

- Mainnet is the primary live blockchain network where assets of value can be
  transferred and smart contract services can be called.
- Testnet is a network with which you can safely test various blockchain
  interactions without the risk of losing valuable asets.
- Both Mainnet and Testnet are fully operational, real blockchains. It is only
  Testnet, however, where you can acquire KDA coins for free from a
  [coin faucet](https://faucet.testnet.chainweb.com). Naturally, account
  balances cannot move between networks.

## Change networks

![change-networks](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/change-networks.png)

You can change the network with which you are actively interacting by selecting
the drop-down arrows beside the displayed network in the Network Display top
bar.

Simply select the desired network from the available list and confirm the
selection. The keys displayed in the wallet will persist across networks, while
the accounts list will refresh to display those that you have added on the
chosen network.

## Create a custom network <a href="#create-a-custom-network" id="create-a-custom-network"></a>

![custom-network](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/custom-network.png)

You can add your own custom network by selecting the appropriate option from the
Settings section.

To create a new network, you will have to define a network name then enter the
addresses for the nodes to which you would like the network to connect. Node
status is displayed with a traffic light style indicator.

Note

Custom networks are defined locally and will only be visible within the
application that created it. It is recommended that a network connect to at
least 3 nodes.

## Keys, Accounts, and Ownership

### Understanding Keys vs. Accounts <a href="#understanding-keys-vs-accounts" id="understanding-keys-vs-accounts"></a>

In brief, Keys sign transactions and Accounts may be governed by one or multiple
keys.

With most blockchains, accounts are modeled as simply public/private keypairs.
This one-to-one model keeps things simple, but runs into problems when account
control requires a many-to-many model (such as with jointly owned or majority
ruled accounts).

Kadena natively supports multiple keys governing the same account, and thus the
distinction between Keys and Accounts becomes important.

Every Account is governed by a keyset which must be defined when creating any
Account. Keysets are composed of two parts; (1) a set of keys and (2) a
predicate

- Set of keys: a list of public keys that are associated to the account
- Predicate: a governance function that determines which keys are allowed to
  make choices for the account when it comes to transactions (e.g. do all keys
  need to be present? only one? two? etc.)

Summarily, keysets look like the following as JSON data:

```
{
  "keys": ["pubkey1", "pubkey2",...,"pubkeyN"],
  "pred": "some governance function"
}
```

When signing a transaction, the list of private keys supplied as signing key
pairs will be checked against the keyset and predicate to ensure that not only
are all keys that need to be present accounted for but also that the predicate
is satisfied.

## Generate a Key

The first step towards transacting on the Kadena blockchain is to generate a key
pair. Chainweaver automatically generates your first key.

![generate-key](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/generate-key.png)

Select the “Generate Key” button to add additional keys to your wallet, then
continue to Accounts.

## Add an account

Accounts are effectively equivalent to your identity on the blockchain. When you
add an Account in Chainweaver, you will be able to view information about it
such as its keyset info and balance on each of the known chains.

![add-account](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/add-account.png)

Select “+ Add Account” to view existing accounts or create a new account.

Optionally, you can add personal notes beside any account. This field is never
seen by the blockchain, and only serves as a personal reference to organize a
user’s wallet.

## Create an account

To create, and effectively own, an account name on Kadena, there must be a
record of it on the blockchain. The recommended method for creating an account
is to simply transfer some funds to it. In doing so, you transfer to and create
the account in a single transaction.

Before transferring to any account, first check to see whether the account name
already exists. Do this by selecting the “Add Account” button and entering the
desired account’s name. If the account does not exist, then you will see “Does
not exist” as the balance for the corresponding Chain ID row.

![create-account](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/account-exist.png)

There are two ways to perform the “transfer & create” operation.

**Method 1: Tx Builder**

- Select “Receive” beside the desired account’s Chain ID row to open the dialog
- Follow the on-screen instructions to define the keyset
- Copy the generated Tx Builder and paste it into the To field in Chainweaver's
  transfer tool or send it to someone else so they can use it to complete the
  transfer

**Method 2: Manual entry**

- Open the Transfer section and fill-in the fields
- Expand the Owner Keyset sub-section to define how keys will govern this new
  account
- Select “Sign & Transfer” to complete the transaction

![create-account](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/account-create.png)

:::note

For convenience, Chainweaver will automatically define the keyset for accounts
that have the same name as the single public key which controls it.

:::

Remember that the Kadena public blockchain network is comprised of many chains
braided together. In effect, each chain is a standalone blockchain, therefore
you will have to create your desired account on each chain for which you want it
to exist. Naturally, the same account name will have a different account balance
on each chain, and may also have different owners or a different keyset. Always
be sure to take note of the chain on which you are transacting.

## Remove an account <a href="#remove-an-account" id="remove-an-account"></a>

To remove an account from view, select the Details button beside the desired
account

Select “Remove Accunt”

Read the warning message and confirm your selection by selecting “Remove
Account”

![remove-account](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/remove-account.png)

## Account ownership

Kadena natively supports multiple keys governing the same account, allowing for
dynamic account controls such as jointly owned accounts or the ability to rotate
which keys may govern an account.

As a result of this novel capability, it is important for users to clearly
understand which accounts they own and which they may not own. For convenience,
Chainweaver displays whether you are the owner of any account that you are
watching.

- If Chainweaver generated all of the keys in an account, it will indicate “yes”
  for Owner
- If Chainweaver generated some but not all keys in an account, it will indicate
  “joint” for Owner
- If Chainweaver generated none of the keys in an account, it will indicate “no”
  for Owner

![ownership-examples](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/ownership-examples.png)

## Transactions

Among other powerful user controls, two concepts are introduced through
Chainweaver which provide the user with greater transparency and control; (1)
granting capabilities and (2) Tx Builder.

**Granting capabilities**

Performing transfers necessitates a call to the blockchain’s coin contract. This
contract describes the rules for transferring coins and one such rule requires
that the Sender account grant the capability to transfer coins in order for the
transaction to be submitted. The act of granting capabilities is akin to
authorizing or signing a transaction. In more advanced scenarios some contracts
require multiple capabilities to be granted. This concept gives the user greater
control and transparency to what they are signing.

**Tx Builder**

This is a JSON blob including the necessary information to build a transaction.
For simple transfers it might include just an account name and chain ID, like
this:

```
{
    "account": "alice",
    "chain": "5"
}
```

For account creation it might also include a keyset, like this:

```
{
    "account": "alice",
    "chain": "5",
    "keyset": {
        "keys": ["368698bf0354b0c04884a185a7eefd20500562cad23bf9c25eee53ddc0ba7d7b"],
        "pred": "keys-all"
    }
}
```

While users will never need to compose this code themselves, it is important to
become familiar with reading it to understand how some blockchain operations
work.

:::note

These two concepts are not necessary to understand or use in order to perform
KDA transfers.

:::

## Receive Kadena (KDA)

There are two recommended approaches for receiving KDA

**Method 1: Tx Builder** — best for receiving KDA from a sender who is also
using Chainweaver

- Select “Receive” beside the desired account’s Chain ID row to open the dialog
- Copy the Tx Builder and share with the sender to complete the transfer

**Method 2: Account Name + Chain ID** — best for receiving KDA from a sender who
is not using Chainweaver

- Share both your Account name and chain ID with the sender to complete the
  transfer

:::note

If the account to which you are receiving KDA does not yet exist, then the
sender will define the keyset which governs the new account. Once KDA has been
transferred, ensure that account ownership was set-up to your liking

:::

## Send Kadena (KDA)

Since the Kadena public blockchain network braids multiple chains together, you
can transfer KDA within a single chain or across two different chains.

**Transfer between the same chain**

Navigate to the Account section and select “Transfer Coins” to reveal the
transfer tool.

Fill in the required fields then select the "Sign & Transfer" button.

This will open the Sign Transfer dialog which allows you to configure
transaction settings.

![transaction-settings](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/transaction-settings.png)

Once satisfied, select Next to view the Signatures tab. If any external
signatures are required, you will be prompted to enter them here.

Preview the transaction to ensure the Summary Data and Transaction Result output
displays the desired outcome. If everything looks correct, select Send Transfer
to submit the transaction to the blockchain.

![transaction-preview](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/transaction-preview.png)

**Transfer between different chains**

This process has one distinct difference from transfers on the same chain. This
time when you configure the transaction, you must select two Gas Payers:

1. Gas payer on the originating chain to initiate the transfer
2. Gas payer on the destination chain to redeem the transfer

![cross-chain-transfer](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/cross-chain-transfer.png)

It may seem unusual to have to pay for gas twice, but consider what is happening
with a cross-chain transfer. In this scenario you are moving coins between two
different blockchains, each with their own ledger. Therefore gas on one chain
cannot pay for executing operations on a different chain.

**Transfer from non-Chainweaver accounts**

In addition to signing transactions from accounts which are owned within the
wallet, Chainweaver also provides an interface to sign transactions from
accounts which are not owned within the wallet. Chainweaver does this by
auto-detecting whether the sending account is owned by the wallet. If the
sending account is not owned by the wallet, Chainweaver will present a field for
the user to enter the required private key(s). This special feature makes it
easier for users to transfer KDA into Chainweaver from external wallets and
exchanges.

## Adjust gas price and gas limit

![adjust-gas](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/adjust-gas.png)

Before you submit any transaction or deploy any smart contract, you will have
the opportunity to configure a few settings. You can adjust both the Gas Price
and the Gas Limit of your transaction. As either of these settings are adjusted,
you can see how these changes might affect Transaction Speed and Max Transaction
Fee.

:::note

Chainweaver does not charge a fee to send or receive a transaction. All
transaction fees go directly to miners as compensation for providing the compute
power required to execute the operation.

:::

## Track your transaction

Once a transaction has been submitted, Chainweaver will display the Transfer
Status as it moves through progress states. The average block time in the Kadena
network is 30 seconds. So depending on the Transaction Speed you assigned, it
may take several blocks before your transaction is successfully mined.

**Transaction success**: When the transaction has been successfully mined in a
block, a Transaction Result will display.

![transaction-success](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/transaction-success.png)

**Transaction failure**: If the transaction fails at any progress state then a
red “X” will appear beside the failing state.

![transaction-fail](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/transaction-fail.png)

If you have a request key from a previously submitted transaction, you can also
display its result by selecting the “Check Tx Status” button.

![request-key](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/request-key.png)

## Smart Contracts

The ability to write, deploy, and call smart contracts from within Chainweaver
makes it one of the most comprehensive workbench tools for blockchain. Navigate
to the Contracts section and utilize the integrated development environment
(IDE) for developing and testing Pact smart contracts.

Pact is the safe and simple smart contract language used for interacting with
the Kadena blockchain. Visit [https://pactlang.org/](https://pactlang.org) for
developer tutorials covering key concepts and real projects you can deploy
yourself.

## Deploy your own smart contract

Once you have written the code for your new smart contract in the code editor,
check the ENV tab of the tool panel on the right side for any error messages
that might be displayed. Once you are satisfied with your code, you can either
select “Load into REPL” or “Deploy.”

- “Load into REPL” will execute the editor text within the local REPL
  environment so that you can test and interact with the contract
- “Deploy” will begin the process of configuring the smart contract for
  execution on the blockchain

![deploy-config](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/deploy-config.png)

Should you select “Deploy,” you will next be prompted to designate the
transaction destination and settings. On the “Sign” tab you must enter any new
capabilities as defined in your contract code, then select the account to
authorize each capability.

![deploy-preview](https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/assets/Chainweaver/deploy-preview.png)

Once all required fields have been entered, select the “Preview” button. Here
you will be able to review and confirm details before submitting the
transaction.

## Call an existing smart contract

Once a contract has been deployed, it will show up in the “Deployed Contracts”
table under the “Module Explorer” tab of the Contracts tool panel. Contracts can
be filtered by chain or through search.

Select “View” beside your chosen contract to reveal all of the available
functions to call.

Select “Call” beside your chosen function to open a three-part dialog:

1. Parameters: enter the required parameters
2. Configuration: choose the transaction settings
3. Sign: grant the required capabilities

Preview the transaction, then select “Create Transaction” to execute the
operation.

## Interact with Dapps

As a user, interacting with dapps is simple. Chainweaver takes advantage of a
novel [wallet signing API](https://github.com/kadena-io/signing-api) which
facilitates communication between dapps and wallets.

First ensure your Chainweaver desktop application is open. When you’re ready to
start some transaction with a dapp, initiate the request by submitting the
required information (e.g. account name) to the dapp.

Once a call has been made, by pressing a button on the dapp interface or through
some other means, the signing API will hit Chainweaver. When Chainweaver
receives an API call, a new dialog will appear within Chainweaver displaying
input data from the dapp.

Review the transaction details and complete the flow as you would for any other
transaction; configure settings, grant capabilities, preview and create.

## Security and Access

### Key pair generation

Kadena uses Ed25519 public/private key pair signatures. Chainweaver can be used
to easily generate compatible key pairs. Alternatively, you can generate key
pairs yourself by following any kind of Ed25519 key generation method such as
[this one](https://github.com/kadena-community/secure-keygen) contributed to our
community GitHub.

:::note

Learn more about Ed25519 [here](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to).

:::

### Basic safety tips

As with any valuable asset, it is important to establish a secure and reliable
method for controlling who has access to it. While Chainweaver is designed to
satisfy strict security standards, you are ultimately responsible for
maintaining the security of your wallet’s access credentials—the password and
recovery phrase.

**Passwords**: Consider using a password manager to generate a strong password
with randomness of character types. If you decide to create a password yourself,
make sure it is not the same or similar to any other password you have ever
used.

**Recovery phrases**: This 12-word phrase is the master seed that generates all
your wallet’s public/private key pairs. With this phrase, anyone can control
your wallet, even from another device. Consider securing more than one copy to
prevent a single point of failure from events like fires, loss, etc.

Kadena does not control any of your personal/private data on our servers. Never
share passwords or recovery phrases with anyone, including the Kadena team. We
will never ask for you to provide this. If someone claims that we do, insist on
not sharing.

#### Who can access your account

Anyone with your wallet's password, private keys or recovery phrase can access
your account. Passwords, private keys, and recovery phrases are in the users’
hands and are the users’ responsibility. Chainweaver is simply an interface that
allows you to more easily interact with your accounts and the Kadena blockchain.

#### Lost password and/or recovery phrase

**Lost password**

If you lose your password, you can reset it by using your 12-word recovery
phrase to restore the wallet with a new password.

**Lost both password and recovery phrase**

If you lose both your password and recovery phrase, you will permanently lose
access to any accounts and their funds forever.

Kadena does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private
keys, or recovery phrases. We only have access to the information that is
publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold
your assets.

## Change password

Change your password by navigating to the Settings section and selecting the
appropriate button.

## Export wallet

Export your wallet by navigating to the Settings section and selecting the
appropriate button.

Exporting wallet data will generate an encrypted file containing sensitive and
non-sensitive information available within the wallet. The file will be
protected by the wallet password that was in use at time of export. Store this
file in a secure location and do not alter its contents.

The wallet data to be exported within this file includes:

- Generated public/private key pairs
- Added accounts
- Account notes
- Network configuration
- Transaction configuration

:::note

This password-protected wallet file can be imported to Chainweaver as a recovery
method to restore the state of the wallet at the time the file was created.

:::

## View and export transaction log

View and export your wallet’s transaction log by navigating to the Settings
section and selecting the appropriate button.

## Log out

The “Log out” button in the lower-left of the Section menu will lock your
wallet. A locked wallet cannot sign transactions or receive signing API calls.

## Codebase

To find out about the latest improvements to Chainweaver, view
[Transactions](chainweaver-user-guide)

Kadena staff will never ask for sensitive information, including passwords,
recovery phrases or private keys.

Beware of fake accounts and scam attempts.

Chainweaver will only communicate through verified channels.
