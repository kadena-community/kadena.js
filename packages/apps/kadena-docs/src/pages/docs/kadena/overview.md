## Why Kadena matters

### Vision

Kadena was founded on the idea that blockchain could revolutionize how the world
interacts and transacts. But to get to mass adoption, chain technology and the
ecosystem connecting it to the business world needed to be reimagined from the
ground up. Our founders built a proprietary chain architecture and created the
tools to make blockchain work for business – at speed, scale, and energy
efficiency previously thought unachievable.

### Behind the tech

Prior to the launch of Kadena in 2016, our founders were already leaders in
blockchain and crytocurrency solutions:

- Stuart Popejoy led JPMorgan’s Emerging Blockchain group.
- Will Martino was recruited from his role as the Tech Lead for the SEC’s
  Cryptocurrency Steering Committee.
- Together, Stuart and Will built JPMorgan’s first blockchain, now known as JPM
  Coin.

Kadena’s advisory team consists of experts such as Dr. Stuart Haber, the
co-inventor of blockchain and the most cited author in Satoshi Nakamoto’s
renowned 2008 Bitcoin white paper.

### Build without compromise with Kadena

Kadena builds technology that makes blockchain work for everyone. Our ecosystem
powers real-world use cases for enterprises and entrepreneurs, providing the
security of Bitcoin, virtually free gas (transaction fees), unparalleled
throughput, as well as Pact – the most secure smart contract language with
built-in bug detection.

### Complete decentralized infrastructure for builders

Kadena is the only platform offering a complete decentralized infrastructure for
builders. Combining a revolutionary chain architecture with the tools needed for
widespread adoption, your teams get the full capabilities of blockchain with the
ability to go from concept to launch in days vs. months by not having to build
from scratch.

### Innovation that works

Kadena was founded on the idea that blockchain could revolutionize how the world
interacts and transacts. But to get to mass adoption, blockchain technology and
the ecosystem connecting it to the business world needed to be reimagined from
the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary multi-chain architecture and the
tools to make blockchain work for everyone – at speed, scale, and with energy
efficiency previously thought unachievable.

### Safer smart contracts

Pact makes designing safer smart contracts effortless, whether you’re writing
your first contract or launching your fiftieth dApp. It’s fundamentally
different from other contract languages. It’s readable by non-developers. It
automatically detects bugs, freeing you from the exploits you’ll face on
Ethereum and other unsafe platforms. And it has been battle-tested in production
applications for over two years.

### Write the future on Pact

Pact is the first truly human readable smart contract language. It lets anyone
write clearly, directly and safely onto a blockchain—a true advance for
automated contracts. Pact automatically detects bugs and keeps the purpose of
code clear. With other contract languages, finding bugs and making sense of fine
print can be nearly impossible. Pact’s Formal Verification lets you test your
contracts to make sure they do what’s intended. Additionally, when you reference
code from other contracts, you stay in control of what happens with your
transactions, even if they change their code.

### Industrial scalability

Unlike other platforms, Kadena is designed to power global financial systems.
Our protocol continually scales to higher TPS (Transactions Per Second) as more
chains are added to the network. With its revolutionary multi-chain
architecture, Kadena is the only scalable layer-1 Proof of Work (PoW) platform
capable of scaling to settle the 9+ million trades executed on the NYSE each
day.

### Proven security

Our founders' experience at JPMorgan revealed the potential for – and
limitations of – existing blockchain solutions. In order to solve for the
security and throughput demands of financial services clients, Kadena’s protocol
runs on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism found in Bitcoin, rather
than Proof of Stake (PoS). To achieve Kadena’s breakthrough scalability, we
braid together multiple Bitcoin-like chains, improving both throughput and
scalability while maintaining the security and integrity found in Bitcoin.

### Energy efficient at scale

As network demand increases, Kadena’s energy use remains constant. Its unique
multi-chain architecture makes it the only platform that can deliver increased
energy efficiency as TPS (Transactions Per Second) scales.

### No-cost transactions

While we offer marginal transaction fees for consumers, we’ve gone a step
further in introducing the first Crypto Gas Stations to allow businesses to
eliminate all transaction fees for their customers, thus removing a key barrier
to mass adoption of dApps.

### The ideal ecosystem

Kadena works with your preferred services, so you can build how you want and
where you want. Empowered with our ecosystem of product and service integrations
across enterprises, mining, DeFi, oracles, interop, smart contracts, wallets and
exchanges, our passionate community of builders, miners, and partners is
changing how the world interacts and transacts.

The Kadena ecosystem offers: Scalable, secure blockchain Pact safer smart
contracts Gas Stations for no-fee transactions dApp toolkit for rapid
development.

## Components of the Kadena Platform

Kadena consists of a (layer 1) public chain protocol called Chainweb and a layer
2 protocol called Kuro. The public and layer 2 networks are interoperable
through the smart contract language Pact.

### 1. Chainweb, Kadena’s (layer 1) public blockchain protocol

HEADLINE: Chainweb is a braided, parallelized proof-of-work consensus mechanism
that improves throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and
integrity found in Bitcoin.

<!-- <YouTube videoId="hYvXxFbsN6I"/> -->

n 2020, Kadena's public blockchain performed a live network expansion from 10
chains to 20 chains. This doubled throughput, proving the networks's ability to
scale in production to meet ever-higher demand.

### 2. Pact, Kadena’s smart contract language

Pact is a human readable and Turing Incomplete smart contract language
purpose-built for blockchains with powerful security features including full
Formal Verification of user code, error messages, contract upgradability,
support for interoperability, and strong permission and access control.

### 4. Kadena's layer 1 + 2

With 20 chains, the Kadena blockchain platform achieves an industry-leading
480,000 transactions per second.

<!-- ![Chainweb nodes have their own “local cluster” of two independent Kuro chains. They synchronize with the Chainweb node using a cross-chain bridge. Kuro chains in the cluster can accept transactions at 8k per second directly from clients and between each other. Thus a single cluster can do 16k TPS. Using the power of both layer 1 and layer 2 networks, Kadena’s blockchain can achieve around 480,000 TPS.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 08.43.48.png>) -->
