# Rotatable Wallet

Welcome to this **Rotatable Wallet** project tutorial!

Here you’ll create a smart contract named **Rotatable Wallets** that
demonstrates many important Pact features that you learned throughout previous
tutorials.

**Topics covered in this tutorial**

- Project Overview
- Define Keysets
- Define Module
- Define Schema and Table
- Functions
- Create Table
- Deploy the Contract

:::note Key Takeaway

Modules can be permissioned to ensure the security of running your code on a
decentralized network and allow for row level permissions when necessary.

:::

## Rotatable Wallet Module Demonstration

The module you will build is called the **Auth** Module and allows for a feature
known as a Rotatable Wallet.

This builds on earlier knowledge and helps demonstrate how keysets can be used
at the "row level" to guard assets. It’s an example of how a Pact smart contract
can manage user keysets in a decentralized fashion allowing users to update
information based on their keyset. The ability to change keyset values is
referred to as **rotating keysets**.

By creating this module, you’ll be able to effectively create smart contracts
that guard assets at a row level and take advantage of functions that allow
users to update information in tables.

## Project Overview

Before getting into the code, take some time to review what you’ll be building.
This smart contract can be broken down into steps focused on 4 core areas that
include the keysets, module, table, and functions.

![1-project-overview](/assets/docs/1-project-overviewrotatable.png)

The details of each step will be described as you progress through the tutorial.
Each step will include a short description ending with a code challenge. If you
get stuck, you can always look at the hints or solutions we provide.

## Project Environment Setup

Each of these options are meant to help support you as you work through these
challenges. Feel free to use them however you’d like to.

When you’re set up to begin, follow along with each step to create your own
Rotatable Wallet Smart Contract!

## 1. Define Keysets

Get started with your smart contract by defining it’s keysets.

The 2 keysets required for this smart contract are a **module-admin-keyset**
that will allow users to define and update modules, and an
**module-operate-keyset** that will allow users to create accounts.

Each of these keysets play a specific role that will be defined later in the
application.

:::caution Code Challenge

Complete define and read the **module-admin-keyset** and the
**module-operate-keyset**.

## 2. Define Module

The next step is to create the module that will contain the logic of your smart
contract.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a module named **auth** that specifies access to the **module-admin**
keyset.

## 3. Define Schema and Table

This smart contract contains a schema named **user** with 2 columns;
**nickname** held as a string and **keyset** which is held as a keyset. Use this
schema to both define and create a table named **users**.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define the user schema and table.

## 4. Create Functions

You're now ready to complete the functions for this module.

| function              | purpose                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **create-user**       | Allows operate-admin to add rows to the user table.          |
| **enforce-user-auth** | Restrict access permissions to users with a given id.        |
| **change-nickname**   | Allow users with a specific keyset to update their nickname. |
| **rotate-keyset**     | Allow the owner of a keyset to change their keyset.          |

The goal of these functions is to allow users the flexibility they need to
create and manage their accounts.

### 4.1 Create User

In this step, you will create a function that allows the **operate-admin** to
add rows to the users table.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a function named **create-user** that takes 3 arguments; id, nickname,
and keyset. Next, restrict access for function calls to the **operate-admin**.
Finally, insert a row into the **users** table using the inputs specified by the
user.

for more information related to completing this challenge.

### 4.2 Enforce User

It’s sometimes useful to restrict access to data to specific users. For example,
users may not want others to see the balance of their account or other sensitive
information. This can be done in Pact by enforcing access to rows of data using
row-level keysets.

The first step toward making this happen is to be able to view the keyset
associated with a specific id. The following function shows an example of
reading a keyset in a specific row from a given id.

```pact title=" "
(defun enforce-keyset-of-id (id)
  (with-read table id { "keyset":= keyset }
  (enforce-keyset keyset)
  keyset)
)
```

This function doesn’t yet give any access to the data in a row. It’s purpose is
for other functions to call on it in the case that they want to do something
like place row level restrictions on data. This will be valuable shortly when
you write code that needs to call this function.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a function named **enforce-user-auth** that returns the keyset associated
with a given id.

and
[bind](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=bindings#bind)
for more information related to completing this challenge.

:::

### 4.3 Change Nickname

Once you can restrict access to data, you’re ready to allow users to take
specific actions based on the data they have access to. For example, a user may
want to update their profile name, or make changes to sensitive information that
other users should not be able to access.

To do that, you can write a function that utilizes the previous function you
created. From there, you can add in functionality that allows users to update
their data.

Here is an example function **update-data** that allows users to update existing
information. It leverages the previous example function **enforce-keyset-of-id**
to make an update to a row in the table **example-table**.

```pact title=" "
(defun update-data (id new-data)
  (enforce-keyset-of-id id)
  (update example-table id { "data": new-data })
  (format "Data updated in row {} to {}" [id new-data]))
```

This function combined with the previous function allows users with a specific
keyset to make updates to restricted information.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a function named **change-nickname** that allows users with a specific
keyset to update their nickname in the **users** table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/rotatable-wallet/2-challenges/4-functions/4.3-change-nickname/challenge.pact)

for more information related to completing this challenge.

:::

### 4.4 Rotate Keyset

Now that users can update their name, you can apply this same functionality to
other information.

For example, you can allow users to update their keyset. The ability to update
keysets is known as ‘rotating keysets’ and this is where the name ‘Rotatable
wallets’ came from for this demonstration. This feature is comparable to being
able to update a password, and it’s an extremely useful feature to have in an
application.

For this final function, use the information learned from previous steps to add
rotating keysets as a feature of your smart contract.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a function named rotate-keyset that allows the owner of a keyset to
change their keyset.

## 5. Create Table

The last step is to create the **user** table defined within the module.

:::caution Code Challenge

Create the user table.

## Deploy the Smart Contract

Your Rotatable Wallet smart contract is complete! If you’d like, you can deploy
this contract similar to how you would deploy other smart contracts.

For more information on deploying this smart contract, view the following
tutorials.

- [Pact Online Editor](/pact/beginner/web-editor)
- [Pact Development on Atom SDK](/pact/beginner/atom-sdk)

## Review

That wraps up this tutorial on the **Rotatable Wallet** application.

Throughout this tutorial, you built a smart contract named **Rotatable Wallets**
that demonstrated many important Pact features that you learned throughout
previous tutorials.

Most importantly, you showed how modules can be permissioned to ensure the
security of running your code on a decentralized network and allow for row level
permissions when necessary.

Having the ability to permission modules is an extremely valuable feature of
Pact, and you can use this in many other applications in the future. Take some
time now to experiment with this feature to try applying it in new situations.

When you’re ready, move to the next tutorial to continue building Pact
applications!
