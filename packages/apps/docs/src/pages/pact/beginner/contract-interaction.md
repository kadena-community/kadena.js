The goal of this tutorial is to learn the basics of building interactions
between modules in Pact. You will go over some of the fundamentals, then build a
smart contract that allows users to both make and authorize payments using
multiple Pact modules.

:::note Key Takeaway

Modules can make use of functions within other modules. This is done first with
[use](/pact/reference/syntax#useh116103), and then by calling the functions from
within the module you are using. Each of these files are then loaded into the
REPL where you can specify function calls and test interactions between these
modules.

## Pact Contract Interaction Overview

Contract interaction allows you to set up more complex smart contracts by
working with modules across multiple files. Having access to separate files
allows you to break up your smart contracts into more manageable sizes. It also
allows you to use helpful files that others have created.

In the image below, you can see that there are 2 files, **module-1** and
**module-2**. In this case, **module-2** is using **module-1** to call functions
that exist within the module. The REPL file then loads and uses both of these
modules to call functions and facilitate the interaction.

![1-overview](/assets/docs/1-overview.png)

The three most helpful Pact functions to keep in mind for Contract Interaction
are **load**, **use**, and **function calls**.

**Load**

Load and evaluate a file.

```bash title=" "
(load "file.repl")
```

**Use**

Import an existing module into a namespace.

```bash title=" "
(use MODULE)
```

Once the interaction is set up between files, all function calls can be done the
same as if the function existed within that file.

## Project Overview

The idea of working with multiple modules and files is easiest to demonstrate
with an example. For that reason, the rest of this tutorial is focused on
getting you up and running with your own project.

Before getting started with this application, take a look at the visual
overview. This provides a summary of each of the features you will be creating
for the Pact Contract Interaction project.

![2-project](/assets/docs/2-project.png)

The goal of this project is to write a function in **auth.pact** to use within
**payments.pact**. **Payments.pact** will then use **auth.pact** to call
specific functions. You will then load modules from both of these files into the
**payments.repl** file to run the interaction between these contracts.

**Project Files**

Each number in the image corresponds to one of the files you will work with.

|                   |                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **auth.pact**     | Responsible for authorizing users.                            |
| **payments.pact** | Responsible for handling payments between users.              |
| **Payments.repl** | Loads and runs modules from both auth.pact and payments.pact. |

:::info

Both auth.pact and payments.pact are smart contracts that you have worked with
in previous tutorials. If you would like to learn more about these smart
contracts, feel free to view each of their tutorials.

- **Auth Module:** [Project: Rotatable Wallet](/pact/beginner/rotatable-wallet)
- **Payments Module:**
  [Accounts and Transfers](/pact/beginner/accounts-and-transfers) :::

There’s not much code to write for this project. Most of it has been written
previously in the tutorials linked above. For this tutorial, focus on
understanding the interactions between the smart contracts, and to take some
time to study how the functions are interacting with each other.

Making the conceptual leap toward understanding the interactions between modules
is going to be extremely valuable as you make more complicated smart contracts.

## Project Environment Setup

To get started, choose a project directory and clone the project resources into
your local environment.

```bash title=" "
git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code.git
```

Change into the **interaction** directory to begin working on this project.

```bash title=" "
cd pact-lang.org-code/interaction
```

Open this directory in atom to see each of the files provided.

```bash title=" "
atom .
```

As you’ll see, there are a few separate folders available to you.

|                |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **start**      | Provides a starting point with all comments for every challenge.                                                                                                            |
| **challenges** | Challenges in the demo are broken out into separate files, allowing you to build your application over time while having the flexibility to experiment with your own ideas. |
| **finish**     | Includes all comments and code for the final application.                                                                                                                   |
| **loans**      | Includes final application without the challenge comments.                                                                                                                  |

Each of these options are meant to help support you as you work through these
challenges. Feel free to use them however you’d like.

## 1. Auth Pact File

The first step of this project is to write the function that you will call from
the **payments** smart contract. You will write this function within the
**auth** smart contract.

:::info

Navigate to **1-start/auth.pact** or to **2-challenges/1-auth-pact** depending
on how you prefer to follow along.

:::

### 1.1 Enforce User Auth

The function you will write will enforce user authentication for payments made
with accounts. This will be a valuable function for restricting access to either
admins or account users, ensuring each user is the only person that has control
over their account.

:::caution Code Challenge

Define a function enforce-user-auth that you can use to verify user
authorization.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/1-auth-pact/1.1-enforce-user-auth/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/1-auth-pact/1.1-enforce-user-auth/solution.pact)

:::

:::info

A function similar to this is covered in Challenge
[4.2 in Project Rotatable Wallet](/pact/beginner/rotatable-wallet#42-enforce-user).
You can look back to this challenge for more information to help get you
started.

:::

## 2. Payments Pact File

Next, you will work on the **payments.pact** file.

The goal is to use the **auth** module, then call the function you wrote within
the **payments** module to specify authorization for users.

:::info

Navigate to **1-start/payments.pact or to 2-challenges/2-payments-pact**
depending on how you prefer to follow along.

:::

### 2.1 Use Auth

The first step is to get access to the **auth** module. You can do this with the
Pact special form [use](/pact/reference/syntax#useh116103).

The syntax for **use** looks like this.

```bash title=" "
(use MODULE)
```

It’s simple but extremely powerful! This is what will allow you to call
functions from the **auth** module.

:::caution Code Challenge

Take a moment now to **use** the **auth** module from within the **payments**
module.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.1-use-auth/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.1-use-auth/solution.pact)
  :::

### 2.2 Create Account

For this application, it’s important that only the administrator has access to
create an account. This is a good use case for the **enforce-user-auth**
function you wrote in the **auth** module.

Since you now have access to the auth module, you can begin working with its
functions. You can call these functions the same as you would call any other
function.

```pact title=" "
(function-name parameter)
```

Take some time now to add this new functionality to your smart contract.

:::caution Code Challenge

Call **enforce-user-auth** from within the **create-account** function to
authorize that the user is an administrator.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.2-create-account/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.2-create-account/solution.pact)
  :::

### 2.3 Get Balance

Another time you may want to authorize a user is when checking the balance of an
account.

The **payment** modules **get-balance** function is an excellent use case for
this. This time, both the administrator and the owner of the account should have
access to view the account balance.

Similar to before, check for authorization within the **get-balance** function.

:::caution Code Challenge

Call **enforce-user-auth** from within the **get-balance** function to authorize
that function is called by the administrator.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.3-get-balance/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.3-get-balance/solution.pact)

:::

### 2.4 Pay

Finally, it’s important that payments are authorized by the owner of the
account. This will ensure that only the person who has the money is able to send
it to others.

:::caution Code Challenge

Finish off the **payment** module by authorizing that the payment is being sent
by the owner of the account.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.4-pay/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/2-payments-pact/2.4-pay/solution.pact)

:::

That completes the payment module.

You are now ready to set up this contract interaction using the
**payments.repl** file!

## 3. Payments REPL File

You can now finish this project by completing on the **payments.repl** file.

:::info

Navigate to **1-start/payments.repl** or to **2-challenges/3-payments-repl**
depending on how you prefer to follow along.

:::

The goal is to use both the **auth** and **payments** module, then coordinate
interactions between them.

### 3.1 Load Auth Module

To get started, you need access to the **auth** module from within the
**payments.repl** file.

This is done using
[load](/pact/reference/functions/repl-only-functions#loadh3327206).

```pact title=" "
(load "file.pact")
```

Try using **load** to complete the code challenge.

:::caution Code Challenge

Load the **auth** module into the **payments.repl** file.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.1-load-auth-module/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.1-load-auth-module/solution.repl)

:::

:::info

Transactions and loading are covered in more detail in
[Testing Pact Code in the SDK](/pact/beginner/test-in-the-sdk).

:::

### 3.2 Load Payments Module

Next, you need to load the **payments** module into the **payments.repl** file.

This can be done the same way as you did with the **auth** module.

:::caution Code Challenge

Load the **payments** module into the **payments.repl** file.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.2-load-payments-module/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.2-load-payments-module/solution.repl)

:::

### 3.3 Use Auth Module

You now have access to both the auth and payments module from within the
**payments.repl** file. After loading each file, you also need to specify that
you are using them.

Like before, this can be done with the special form **use**.

```pact title=" "
(use MODULE)
```

:::caution Code Challenge

Use the **auth** module from within the **payments.repl** file.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.3-use-auth-module/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.3-use-auth-module/solution.repl)

:::

### 3.4 Use Payments Module

Finally, you need to use the payments module. Write one final line of code that
uses the payments module and completes your set up for contract interaction.

:::caution "Code Challenge"

Use the **payments** module from within the **payments.repl** file.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.4-use-payments-module/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/interaction/2-challenges/3-payments-repl/3.4-use-payments-module/solution.repl)

:::

You are now finished setting up your contract interaction. Congratulations!

---

## 4. Run REPL File

After completing your contract interaction project, you can now see it all work
together.

To do this, navigate back to your terminal.

From the terminal, you can navigate into **1-start** folder if you have worked
within this directory. If not, you can also navigate to the **3-finish** folder
for an example of the completed application.

```bash title=" "
cd 3-finish
```

Open Pact.

```bash title=" "
pact
```

Load the **payments.repl** file.

```bash title=" "
(load "payments.repl")
```

The output to your terminal should look similar to the image shown below.

![3-load-payments](/assets/docs/3-load-payments.png)

:::info

## Review

Congratulations on completing this introduction to Pact Contract Interaction!

In this tutorial, you learned the basics of contract interaction and built a
smart contract that allowed users to both make and authorize payments. This
allowed you to extend the functionality of your smart contract to include
multiple files, and you can now use this to build more complex smart contracts
in any project.

Take a look back at some of the modules you have written or examples that you’ve
come across. Are there any interesting new ways that you think these contracts
could work together? Give it a try and see if you can come up with an entirely
new smart contract that combines these interesting features in new ways!
