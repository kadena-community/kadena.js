## Kadena Ambassador program

community up to date, writing blog posts, or educating new members about the
Kadena project, they have help promote Kadena and spread awareness.

As a way to motivate and recognize these members of our community, Kadena will
be selecting individuals to serve as Kadena Ambassadors.

​While compensation is described above by reference to U.S Dollar (“USD”), all
compensation due an Ambassador will be paid solely in an equivalent amount of
KDA Tokens. The number of KDA you receive for services or content in the prior
month will be based on the market value of the KDA Tokens within not more than
\[48] hours of transfer of the KDA to you. Kadena will determine the market
value in good faith judgment and we expect to establish that value by reference
