## Introduction

This tutorial runs through a working demonstration of a simple todo app. The app
will look like this.

![1-todos-intermediate](/assets/docs/1-todos-intermediate.png)

It allows you to organize your agenda by adding tasks with due dates that you
can later update or delete if needed. You can add, complete, and clear tasks,
and you can view tasks based on their status.

Like other Todo apps, it’s a great way to look at the basic functionality of the
language while creating a useful app that you can use for yourself.

You can find the Github page for this todo app from the Pact language GitHub
page [here](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-todomvc). If you’d like, you can
try putting together the application from this documentation, and if you’d
prefer, you can follow along with this tutorial where I’ll go through each step
in detail.

There’s a lot going on in this tutorial. If you stick with it, it’s totally
worth it. While this setup helps you get up and running with the todo app, it’s
also the same setup you’ll use for many other Pact applications.

## Install Project Dependencies

Before getting started on the project, there are a few project dependencies you
will need to run the application on your local computer. In this section, you’ll
install each of these dependencies to get ready to run the TodoMVC locally.

**Dependencies**

- Pact
- Pact-lang-api
- TodoMVC
- Nodejs

:::info Key Takeaway

In the previous tutorial, you installed **Pact** and the **pact-lang-api**.
These are required for this tutorial.

:::

Note that Pact 3.0 or higher is required for this tutorial. You can check your
Pact version using the following command.

```bash title=" "
pact -v
```

Take some time now to re-install Pact if it is a version lower than 3.0.

### Install Node.js

To create a JavaScript application on your computer, you’ll need to install and
run Node.js.

If you don’t already have this on your computer, you can navigate to
[Download | Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to get started.

![2-nodejs-intermediate](/assets/docs/2-nodejs-intermediate.png)

Make sure to install a node version >= 8.11.4

You can check your version using the following command in your terminal.

```bash title=" "
node -v
```

### Clone Project Files

Now that you’ve installed Pact and Nodejs, you can clone the project files into
a local directory.

From your terminal, navigate into the project directory where you’d like to
create the application.

```bash title=" "
cd myProjectDirectory
```

Clone the [Pact-todomvc](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-todomvc) application.

```bash title=" "
git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/Pact-todomvc.git
```

Change into the todo-mvc project directory.

```bash title=" "
cd Pact-todomvc
```

:::info

We use npm package named **pact-lang-api** to send Pact commands into the Pact
server.

      This needs to be installed along with other npm packages that the app is built on. The required npm packages are saved in package.json file, and the following command installs all required npm packages "npm i"

:::

## Project Setup

### Create Log folder

Pact features a full REST API HTTP server and SQLite database implementation.
The Pact server simulates a single-node blockchain environment and will help you
store and manipulate test data for your application.

Application data for the server is stored within a log folder.

To get started, you need to create the log folder within your project directory.

```bash title=" "
cd Pact-todomvc
mkdir log
```

## Start the Pact Server

Next, run the following command to start the Pact server.

```bash title=" "
npm run start:Pact
```

![3-start-the-pact-server-intermediate](/assets/docs/3-start-the-pact-server-intermediate.png)

This Pact server will provide a log of each action that takes place on the
application.

:::info

The command, "Pact --serve server.conf" launches a Pact server.

      Everytime the server starts, we want to clear previous server's logs and create a new log directory, so we actually run the following command,

      `"rm -Rf ./log && mkdir log && Pact --serve server.conf"`

      We saved this script in package.json file [here](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-todomvc/blob/master/package.json) and can simply run the command `npm run start:Pact`

:::

## Seed the Blockchain

Finally, open another terminal window within the same directory and run the
following command to seed data into your application.

```bash title=" "
npm run Pact:seed
```

![4-seed-the-blockchain-intermediate](/assets/docs/4-seed-the-blockchain-intermediate.png)

:::info

Similar to when you ran the server, you’ll see that seeding the database calls
another file, initialize-todos.sh.

      You can find **initialize-todos.sh** in the project directory. What this does is load the **todos.pact** contract by making a send request with **load-todos.yaml** files.

      Looking at load todos.yaml you can see the codefile, todo-admin-keyset, keypairs, and nonce that is loaded by **initialize-todos.sh**.

:::

The initial seed data will include the status and response shown as a hash
value.

## Package.json

Finally you can see how both `start:pact` and `pact:seed` are working by looking
into the **package.json** file. Under scripts, you can see that `start:pact` is
set to call the server.conf file and that `pact:seed` is set to call the
**initialize-todos.sh** file.

The script to run this part is also saved in **package.json** file, so we can
simply run `npm run Pact:seed`.

## Start the Web Application

After starting the Pact server and seeding the blockchain, you can now start the
web application on your local server.

```bash title=" "
npm start
```

![5-start-the-web-application-intermediate](/assets/docs/5-start-the-web-application-intermediate.png)

## View the App

The project is now available for you to view on your localhost! When you ran
**npm start** your browser may have opened automatically to the application. If
not, you can open to http://localhost:3000 to view the application now.

The todo app should currently look like this in your browser.

![6-view-the-web-application-intermediate](/assets/docs/6-view-the-web-application-intermediate.png)

## Interact with the Application

Now that the app is running, try entering some Todos to get used to the
functionality of the app.

In my application I’ll add the following tasks.

- Learn Pact
- Complete Pact and JavaScript Tutorial

Next, I’ll complete one of the tasks I created.

- Complete Learn Pact

![7-todos-intermediate](/assets/docs/7-todos-intermediate.png)

Feel free to add whatever todos you would like to get a better feel for the
application. Coming up you’ll take a look at the project files along with the
data you generated.

## View Project Files

Having a feel for how the application works, you can now view the project files.
To view these files, open a new terminal within the project directory and type
the following command to open the project.

```bash title=" "
atom .
```

![8-view-project-files-intermediate](/assets/docs/8-view-project-files-intermediate.png)

### Project Directory Overview

Within the project folder are each of the files installed from the project
repository, the dependencies installed with `npm install`, and the files you
created yourself. Most of these files are specific to the front end side of this
web application, but the ones unique to the Pact application are in the **log
folder** and **Pact folder**.

### View the Log Folder

View the **log folder** you created earlier to see that it’s now filled with
**sqlite** files. These files are a sort of emulated blockchain that you can use
to create tables and store or retrieve data.

![9-view-log-folder-intermediate](/assets/docs/9-view-log-folder-intermediate.png)

### View the Pact Folder

The Pact folder contains the **.pact** and **.repl** files that build, run, and
test the smart contract. In here you’ll see **todos.pact** and **todos.repl**.
The **.pact** file is the smart contract for this application, and the **.repl**
file is what loads and runs tests on the Pact file.

![10-view-pact-folder-intermediate](/assets/docs/10-view-pact-folder-intermediate.png)

### View the Front End Application

Inside of the **src** folder you will see the front end code for this
application including the **components**, **html**, **jsx**, and **css** files.
This is a react application, but the front end could use any library or
framework you prefer.

![11-view-front-end-application-intermediate](/assets/docs/11-view-front-end-application-intermediate.png)

If you’re unfamiliar with react you can visit
[React - A JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
to get started with react applications.

## Smart Contract Code

To understand how each of the UI elements are working with the database, take
some time to view the Pact smart contract. As you’ll see, there is a single todo
table that you can access using a variety of functions as shown below.

### Todo Table

Here is the schema of the todo table.

|           |        |
| --------- | ------ |
| title     | string |
| completed | bool   |
| deleted   | bool   |

### Smart Contract Functions

Here is a list of functions from the smart contract along with their purpose.

|                    |                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| new-todo           | Adds a new todo to the database.                    |
| toggle-todo-status | Changes the status of the todo within the database. |
| edit-todo          | Edits the title of the todo within the database.    |
| delete-todo        | Deletes the todo from the database.                 |
| read-todo          | Reads a single todo from the database.              |
| read-todos         | Reads all todos from the database.                  |

:::info

While the code here is new, most of the functionality is covered in previous
tutorials throughout the
[Pact beginner tutorials](/learn-pact/beginner/welcome-to-pact). If you have not
completed these tutorials, take some time to look through them now to get a
better understanding of this Pact smart contract.

:::

As a quick refresher of what this Pact code is doing, here is a look at the code
used to create the todo table and add a new todo.

### Create Todo Schema and Table

Here you can see a schema is defined for a table named todo that is later
defined and created. This table includes rows for title, completed, and deleted.

```pact title=" "
;; todo schema and table
(defschema todo
  "Row type for todos."
   title:string
   completed:bool
   deleted:bool )

(deftable todo-table:{todo})

;; todo table created outside of module

```

### New Todo

The function new-todo adds a todo using the title input generated by the user.
The application assigns the title a specific ID and uses that to generate the
title as specified by the user, and an initial completed and deleted status of
false.

```pact title=" "
(defun new-todo (id title)
  "Create new todo with ENTRY and DATE."
  (insert todo-table id {
    "title": title,
    "completed": false,
    "deleted": false })
)
```

A lot of the remaining code works similar to new-todo with slightly different
functionality based on its purpose. Take some time to review each of these
functions now to familiarize yourself with the application.

### JavaScript

React uses the **pact-lang-api** to interact with Pact and update the database
depending on the actions of the user. An understanding of the entire application
takes some background in React and JavaScript. For this tutorial, we’ll focus on
the functionality that is specific to interacting with Pact.

To get started, navigate to **src > components > todo-app.jsx**

![12-javascript-inter](/assets/docs/12-javascript-inter.png)

Within this file, you’ll see the consts, component, functions, and rendering
used to connect react to Pact.

### Imports

First, note that aside from a few standard react imports, this file also imports
Pact from the Pact-lang-api, as well as the TodoItem and TodoFooter.

```typescript title=" "
import * as React from 'react';
import uuidv4 from 'uuid/v4';
import Pact from 'Pact-lang-api';

import { TodoItem } from './todo-item.jsx';
import { TodoFooter } from './footer.jsx';
```

### Consts

There are also a few constants set that you’ll see used throughout the functions
below including KP - which calls a specific function within the pact lang api to
generate a keypair, API_HOST, and consts related to the TODO state within the
database.

```typescript title=" "
const ENTER_KEY = 13;
const KP = Pact.crypto.genKeyPair();
const API_HOST = 'http://localhost:9001';

const ALL_TODOS = 'all';
const ACTIVE_TODOS = 'active';
const COMPLETED_TODOS = 'completed';
```

Here’s a quick overview of how each of their functions are associated.

|                  |                    |                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getTodos()       | read-todos         | Fetches all todos and returns current information from database. |
| add()            | new-todo           | Adds todo to database given title input from user.               |
| toggle()         | toggle-todo-status | Toggles single todo-status between active and complete.          |
| toggleAll()      | toggle-todo-status | Updates all todo-status between active and complete.             |
| destroy()        | delete-todo        | Updates deleted field of the todo to true.                       |
| clearCompleted() | delete-todo        | Clears completed todo’s from the database.                       |
| save(todo, text) | edit-todo          | Saves todo to the database.                                      |

One thing to note here is delete-todo, which can be a bit misleading. You can’t
actually delete data from a blockchain, so rather than delete the data, it
toggling the status of the delete field to true.

:::info

Todo-app imports todo-item and uses some of its functionality throughout each of
these functions. Take some time now to familiarize yourself with both of these
files in more detail.

:::

### add() > new-todo demo

Let’s look at one example in detail. In this case we can look more closely at
how **add()** calls **new-todo** from todos.pact.

#### New-todo

This function is called by add().

```pact title=" "
(defun new-todo (id title)
"Create new todo with ENTRY and DATE."
(insert todo-table id {
  "title": title,
  "completed": false,
  "deleted": false })
)
```

#### Add()

This function is used to add a todo to the database and display it on the
website for the user.

```typescript title=" "
add(title) {
const uuid = uuidv4();
const cmdObj = {
  pactCode: Pact.lang.mkExp('todos.new-todo', uuid, title),
  keyPairs: KP
};

Pact.fetch.send(cmdObj, API_HOST)
  .then(() => this.getTodos());
}
```

Here are some details about how this function works to add and display a new
todo onto the application.

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inputs    | Add() is taking in the title as input by the user in the application.                                                                                                                                     |
| Consts    | Before sending this to pact, the function sets a const named uuid that utilizes the uuidv4 library that was imported at the top of the file.                                                              |
| cmdObj    | This is used as an object to specify information you’d like to include in the API call. Within the cmdObj we specify the pact code along with the keypairs.                                               |
| Pact Code | The pact code we use here is Pact.lang.mkExp.                                                                                                                                                             |
| mkExp     | A helper function for constructing native pact commands. In this case that’s valuable because it allows you to call a the function new-todo from todos.pact, and to specify the inputs of uuid and title. |
| Keypair   | After the pact code, you’ll see the generated keypair. This is using the constant KP, which as you’ve seen above uses Pact.crypto.genKeyPair to generate a public key.                                    |

:::info

You can see more about this on the **pact-lang-api** website. It generates both
a public and secret key as a string. You may recognize the public key as the
hash value that was returned in the terminal earlier.

:::

#### Pact.fetch

Next, you’ll see **Pact.fetch.send** which is a request to execute a command on
the pact server.

In this function, pact.fetch.send includes the cmdObj built above, along with a
specified **API_HOST**. This **API_HOST** is the constant set above, and is the
**localhost:9001** that you saw the pact server initiate from your terminal.

Once that’s done the todo is in the database. The last step is to show this data
on the website for the user.

:::info

There are other pact.fetch functions including local, poll, and listen. Each of
these have slightly different use cases that you can explore in the
documentation.

:::

#### getTodos()

That’s where this last line comes in. After sending the data to the database,
this line calls **getTodos()** which is another function in this JavaScript
file. This function is what fetches data from the database and displays it on
the website.

It looks like a lot, but having seen the add function in depth, see if you can
parse out what is going on in this function.

## Review

At this point you should be in a good place to continue playing around with the
TodoMVC application.

Try experimenting with the look and feel of it to make it your own. Later you
can try tweaking the code to see how it affects the application, and finally you
can try writing your own functions that extend the functionality of this
application to do whatever you’d like.

As a quick recap, you installed each of the dependencies required to create a
full stack blockchain application with pact. From there, you set up the todoMVC
project, investigated the project files, and then dove into the details of how
pact and JavaScript communicating using the pact-lang-api.

After getting comfortable with this application, you’ll be in a great place to
build applications of your own for entirely different use cases.
