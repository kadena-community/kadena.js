# Property and Invariant Functions

These are functions available in properties and invariants -- not necessarily in
executable Pact code. All of these functions are available in properties, but
only a subset are available in invariants. As a general rule, invariants have
vocabulary for talking about the shape of data, whereas properties also add
vocabulary for talking about function inputs and outputs, and database
interactions. Each function also explicitly says whether it's available in just
properties, or invariants as well.
