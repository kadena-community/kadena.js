[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6-MaxD2hlcGLL70ukHotA) to
access the latest Pact tutorials.

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this tutorial, it helps to have completed the following
pre-requisites.

- [Pact Development on Atom SDK]/learn-pact/beginner/atom-sdk) : The SDK is
  required for testing in the SDK. You can get up and running with the SDK using
  this tutorial.

- [Project: Loans](/docs/pact/beginner/loans) : You will be building a REPL file
  for the Loans project covered in a separate tutorial. This isn’t required but
  is a helpful way to better understand the smart contract used throughout this
  tutorial.

## REPL Overview

REPL files are used to load and run Pact files using the SDK.

REPL stands for read - eval - print - loop. This acronym refers to the idea that
given a Pact file, a REPL file is responsible for reading, evaluating, printing,
and looping through the code as needed to both run and provide the output of the
Pact file.

These are a common part of LISP-like languages such as Pact and they allow you
to quickly test the smart contracts you build.

A simple way to load a REPL file is from your terminal as shown below.

![1-repl-overview](/assets/docs/1-repl-overview.png)

Using your terminal window, you will load the REPL file. This includes code that
both loads and runs the pact file. The pact file then returns data to the REPL
file which sends the output to your terminal window.

### Comparison to Online Editor

To better grasp the importance of the REPL file, it helps to look at a tool you
may be more familiar with - the [online editor](https://pact.kadena.io/).

![2-online-editor](/assets/docs/2-online-editor.png)

Many features provided by the online editor’s UI are things that you will need
to code for yourself in a local or production environment. Things like loading
the pact file into the REPL, setting up the environment data and keys, and
making function calls will all be done from within the REPL file.

![3-online-editor-callouts](/assets/docs/3-online-editor-callouts-e658cfb55f5db40590426ae1364d01bb.png)

You will complete all of this and other important testing features using the
Pact REPL only built-in functions.

## Built-in Functions

When building a REPL file, there are many built-in functions available to you.

These functions are known as the
[REPL only functions](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#repl-only-functions)
because they cannot be used in pact files. While all of these built-in functions
are valuable, there are some that are more commonly used.

Take some time now to review each of the functions in the documentation as well
as the summary of commonly used functions provided below.

| function                                                                                  | purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [begin-tx](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#begin-tx)   | Begin a transaction.                                            |
| [commit-tx](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#commit-tx) | Commit a transaction.                                           |
| [env-data](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#env-data)   | Set transaction data.                                           |
| [env-keys](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#env-keys)   | Set transaction signature keys.                                 |
| [expect](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#expect)       | Evaluate expression and verify that it equals what is expected. |
| [load](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#load)           | Load and evaluate a file.                                       |

Coming up, you will create a .REPL file for yourself that uses many of the
functions listed above.

## Project Environment Setup

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, you will build a REPL file for yourself.

To follow along from your local environment, clone the repo pact-lang.org-code
GitHub repo.

```bash title=" "
git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code.git
```

Change into the **test-in-sdk** directory to begin working on this project.

```bash title=" "
cd pact-lang.org-code/test-in-sdk
```

Open this directory in atom to see each of the files provided.

```bash title=" "
atom .
```

As you’ll see, there are a few separate folders available to you.

|                |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **start**      | Provides a starting point with all comments for every challenge.                                                                                                            |
| **challenges** | Challenges in the demo are broken out into separate files, allowing you to build your application over time while having the flexibility to experiment with your own ideas. |
| **finish**     | Includes all comments and code for the final application.                                                                                                                   |
| **loans**      | Includes final application without the challenge comments.                                                                                                                  |

Each of these options are meant to help support you as you work through these
challenges. Feel free to use them however you’d like.

## 1. Load Environment Data

The first step in creating a .repl file is to load the environment keys and
data.

This is similar to what you have seen in the
[online editor](https://pact.kadena.io/). Rather than creating this data from
the UI like you did before, you now need to program this information into your
.repl file.

The online editor allowed you to create keys and keysets using the tool panel as
shown below. The **result tab** shows data similar to what you will be writing
into your .repl file.

![4-keysets](/assets/docs/4-keysets.png)

You can view the code that represents your keys and keysets using the **Result**
tab.

![5-result](/assets/docs/5-result.png)

To set up this environment using the .repl file, you will use two separate built
in functions; **env-keys** and **env-data**.

| function                                                                                                                 | purpose                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [env-keys](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#env-keys) | Set transaction signature keys.                                                        |
| [env-data](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#env-data) | Set transaction JSON data, either as encoded string, or as pact types coerced to JSON. |

**env-keys example**

```bash title=""
(env-keys ["my-key" "admin-key"]) "Setting transaction keys"
```

**env-data example**

```bash title=""
(env-data { "keyset": { "keys": ["my-key" "admin-key"], "pred": "keys-any" } })
"Setting transaction data"
```

:::caution Code Challenge

For this code challenge, you will use **env-keys** and **env-data** to load the
keys and environment data into the .repl file. Use the comments to help guide
you, and if you’re unsure how to move forward, take a look at the solution for
more details.

:::info

Looking at the **loans.pact** file could be a helpful way to understand what you
are trying to do in the **loans.repl** file. This file exists in the project
directory under **3-finish**.

:::

## Note About Transactions

Before moving on, there’s an important note to make about transactions.

When working within REPL files, you can make as many calls to the pact code
within a transaction as you like. Any command sent to the blockchain is a
transaction, but a command too can have multiple calls, for instance, defining a
module with `module` and creating its tables with `create-table` calls.

To successfully execute a transaction you need to both begin the transaction and
commit the transaction. This is done using **begin-tx** and **commit-tx**.

| function                                                                                                                   | purpose                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [begin-tx](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#begin-tx)   | Begin transaction with optional NAME. |
| [commit-tx](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#commit-tx) | Commit transaction.                   |

It’s valuable to use these built-in functions to group calls into small
transactions within your REPL file.

Here’s why this is useful.

**Error Example**

Any error that occurs in a transaction will cause it to roll back and fail to
run.

While it's possible to place all of your calls within a single transaction, this
isn’t a good habit to get into. This will make it difficult to tell where your
file is failing and make it difficult to continue testing.

For that reason, be sure to break up your test files into smaller transactions.

```bash title=""
(begin-tx)
;; This could fail and I would know where the problem is
(commit-tx)

(begin-tx)
;; This could fail and I would know where the problem is
(commit-tx)

(begin-tx)
;; This could fail and I would know where the problem is
(commit-tx)
```

Transactions can be grouped together however is most convenient for your
testing. Try maintaining a logical order in your transactions for ease of
maintenance and readability.

## 2. Load Pact File

Pact files are not run by your computer directly, they’re loaded into the .repl
file and run from there. Now that you have loaded the environment data, you need
to load the pact file into the .repl file.

This is done using the built-in **load** function.

| function                                                                                                         | purpose                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [load](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html?highlight=built%20in%20functions#load) | Load and evaluate FILE. |

The syntax for this is simple.

**load example**

```bash title=""
(load "accounts.pact")
```

All you need to do type load then specify the file path as a string. Pact and
REPL files are generally kept in the same folder so you usually only need to
specify the name of the pact file.

:::caution Code Challenge

Load the loans.pact file into the REPL.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/test-in-sdk/2-challenges/2-load-pact-file/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/test-in-sdk/2-challenges/2-load-pact-file/solution.repl)

:::

## 3. Call Functions

Now that the pact file is loaded into the REPL file, you are ready to start
calling its functions.

To do this, specify the module name with **use**, then call the functions from
within the module.

**Function Call Example**

```bash title=" "
(begin-tx)
(use module-name)
(function-name "input-1" "input-2")
(commit-tx)
```

### 3.1 Generate Data

For this code challenge, you will need to make calls to a few functions from the
loans project. Here is a brief overview of each of the functions you will call.

| function                                                  | purpose                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [create-a-loan](/docs/pact/beginner/loans#52-createaloan) | Accepts parameters to add the appropriate information to each table |
| [assign-a-loan](/docs/pact/beginner/loans#53-assignaloan) | Assigns a loan to an entity.                                        |
| [sell-a-loan](/docs/pact/beginner/loans#54-sellaloan)     | Sell a loan and log details in the loan history table.              |

Follow the links provided or view the loans.pact file for more details.

:::caution Code Challenge

Call the **create-a-loan**, **assign-a-loan**, and **sell-a-loan** functions
from the loans.pact file and provide your own inputs as needed.

:::info

If you have not already completed the
[Project: Loans tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/loans)

, try working through this tutorial to build the entire Loans smart contract for
yourself!

:::

### 3.2. Read Loans

After calling functions used to create, assign, and sell a loan, you can now
read some of the data that you created. Similar to before, you will be calling
functions from the loans.pact file. Feel free to reference the previous
challenge for guidance.

Here is a brief overview of the functions you will call in this challenge.

| function                                                                    | purpose                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [read-loan-inventory](/docs/pact/beginner/loans#59-readloaninventory)       | Reads all loans in the loan inventory table. |
| [read-loans-with-status](/docs/pact/beginner/loans#510-readloanswithstatus) | Reads all loans with a specific status.      |

:::caution Code Challenge

Call the read-loan-inventory and read-loans-with-status functions from the
loans.pact file and provide your inputs as needed.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/test-in-sdk/2-challenges/3-call-functions/3.2-read-loans/challenge.repl)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/test-in-sdk/2-challenges/3-call-functions/3.2-read-loans/solution.repl)

:::

## Run REPL File

At this point you have completed the REPL file. Congratulations! The last step
is to run the file from your terminal to view the output.

To do this, open your terminal and navigate to the **3-finish** directory from
your project folder.

```bash title=" "
cd 3-finish
```

Run pact.

```bash title=" "
pact
```

Loan the loans.repl file

```bash title=" "
pact> (load "loans.repl")
```

You should see an output to your terminal similar to the data shown below.
Notice the flags similar to those that you’ve seen throughout the challenges.
This is to help you see where the code you wrote is corresponding to the output
in the terminal.

Take some time now to view the output and see how it aligns with the code you
wrote in the REPL file.

```bash title=" "

```

You can experiment with changing the .repl or .pact files to see how this
changes the output in your terminal.

## Built-in Error Messages

As you’ve seen, you can run REPL files from your terminal to test Pact code.

Another valuable feature in the SDK is that it actually runs these files for you
without using the terminal. This helps you spot errors from directly within
Atom. Two features that help you spot errors are the error highlighting and the
error message.

|                        |                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Error Highlighting** | Shows up as red dot on line that includes error. REPL files with errors in them will have a red squiggly line under the file name. |
| **Error Message**      | Gives details about the error source.                                                                                              |

These are both valuable ways to effectively test and debug your Pact code.

### Pact Examples

To view these features take a look at our **pact-examples** repo.

Change into your **pact-examples** directory or clone this repo into your
project folder if you have not set this project up before.

```bash title=" "
git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-examples.git
```

Change into the **pact-examples** directory.

```bash title=" "
cd pact-examples
```

Open this directory in atom.

```bash title=" "
atom .
```

Here you will see many more examples of REPL files along with the smart
contracts they are testing.

**Navigate to atoz > keysets > keysets.repl** to view one of these examples.

![6-keysets-repl](/assets/docs/6-keysets-repl-5d449f3cba88a30eb9d0613902e9d99f.png)

In this file you will notice the use of a new built-in function named
**expect-failure**. Both expect-failure and expect allow you to test if the
outcome of an expression is what you would have expected.

|                                                                                                     |                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [expect](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#expect)                 | Evaluate expression and verify that it equals what is expected.  |
| [expect-failure](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#expect-failure) | Evaluates the expression and succeed only if it throws an error. |

On line 35, notice the line that states that it expects the real-keyset should
fail.

```pact title=" "
(expect-failure "real keyset should fail"
  (enforce-keyset 'keyset-real))
```

You can tell that this test is passing because there is no error message or
highlighting.

To make this test fail, try changing **keyset-real** to **keyset-carol**.

```pact title=" "
(expect-failure "real keyset should fail"
  (enforce-keyset 'keyset-carol))
```

After making this change, the filename **keysets.repl** should now have a red
squiggle under it and line 35 should have a red dot next to it. Both of these
indicate that a test is failing within the REPL file.

![7-errors](/assets/docs/7-errors-46716e2cc8d021cfc8ee72d0ced335a9.png)

To get more information, you can click the dot on line 35 and select the
triangle to view the source of the error as shown below. Using this detailed
information you can better test and debug the code from within your Pact smart
contract.

:::info

To understand exactly what is failing and why, it helps to look through both the
.pact and .repl files for more information. Take some time now to study the
keyset example files as well as a few other examples to practice testing code
and debugging errors.

### Review

Congratulations on completing this introduction to **Testing Pact Code in the
SDK**!

In this tutorial, you learned both the basics of testing in the SDK and how to
build your own REPL file. This is a great start to begin testing the smart
contracts you build locally. From here, you can experiment with changing the
.repl or .pact files to see how this changes the output in your terminal.

Using this workflow, you can begin building and testing files however you would
like.
