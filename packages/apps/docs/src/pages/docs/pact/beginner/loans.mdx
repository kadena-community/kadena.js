- Deploy Smart Contract

The goal of this tutorial is to ensure you understand the building blocks of
Pact applications, eventually navigating you toward building more complex
applications. It’s also meant to push you toward solving problems that you may
not have seen before to build valuable new applications.

:::note Key Takeaway

Loan creation and management is an excellent use case of Pact smart contracts.
By combining what you know about modules, schemas, tables, and functions in new
ways, you can already build useful and simple applications for complex problems.

:::

## Loans Smart Contract

Throughout this tutorial, you’ll get hands on and build a smart contract used to
create, distribute, and manage loans.

This smart contract uses schemas and tables pretty extensively and will give you
great experience setting up tables as well as writing many different functions
that can be used to create and manipulate data within these tables.

A brief overview of each feature you’ll build is provided below.

![1-loans-overview](/assets/docs/1-loans-overview.png)

As you can see, there are many different tables, const values, and functions
meant to help provide a range of functionality for your users.

:::info

There is a lot of code in this application, and it will force you to think more
proactively about how to solve each problem than earlier tutorials had done. If
you get stuck, try using all of the resources provided, and look to the solution
for further guidance if needed.

:::

When you’re ready, continue to the next section to start building your Loans
smart contract!

## Project Environment Setup

To get started, choose a project directory and clone the project resources into
your local environment.

```bash title=" "
git clone https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code.git
```

Change into the **loans** directory to begin working on this project.

```bash title=" "
cd pact-lang.org-code/loans
```

Open this directory in atom to see each of the files provided.

```bash title=" "
atom .
```

As you’ll see, there are a few separate folders available to you.

|                |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **start**      | Provides a starting point with all comments for every challenge.                                                                                                            |

| **loans**      | Includes final application without the challenge comments.                                                                                                                  |

Each of these options are meant to help support you as you work through these
challenges. Feel free to use them however you’d like to.

## 1. Module and Keyset

The first step is to create the module and keysets for your smart contract.

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a keyset named **loans-admin-keyset** and a module named **loans** that
specifies access to this keyset.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/1-module-and-keyset/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/1-module-and-keyset/solution.pact)

:::

:::info

If you’re unfamiliar with modules and keyset, our
[Pact Modules Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/modules) is a great place to get
started.

:::

## 2. Define Schemas

The first step to build your module is to create the schema definitions for each
table.

The loans smart contract will consist of 3 tables as shown below.

![2-loans-overview](/assets/docs/2-define-schemas.png)

For this challenge, you’ll see each table presented as fields and types. Your
goal is to create the schema definition for each of these tables.

:::info

Schema definitions are introduced in the
[Schemas and Tables Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/schemas-and-tables#define-schemas).

:::

### 2.1 Loan Schema

The loan table will be used to hold loan entries.

**loan table**

| fieldname  | fieldtype |
| ---------- | --------- |
| loanName   | string    |
| entityName | string    |
| loanAmount | integer   |
| status     | string    |

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to define the schema for the **loan** table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.1-loan/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.1-loan/solution.pact)

:::

### 2.2 Loan History Schema

The **loan-history** table will be used to track the loan’s histories. It
includes each of the **field names** and **field types** shown below.

**loan-history table**

| fieldname | fieldtype |
| --------- | --------- |
| loanId    | string    |
| buyer     | string    |
| seller    | string    |
| amount    | integer   |

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to define the schema for the **loan-history** table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.2-loan-history/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.2-loan-history/solution.pact)

:::

### 2.3 Loan Inventory Schema

The **loan-inventory** table will be used to hold inventory balance.

**loan-inventory table**

| fieldname | fieldtype |
| --------- | --------- |
| balance   | integer   |

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to define the schema for the **loan-inventory** table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.3-loan-inventory/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/2-define-schemas/2.3-loan-inventory/solution.pact)

:::

## 3. Define Tables

Having defined each of the schemas for each table in your smart contract, you
are now ready to define the tables.

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to define each of the tables for the loans smart contract.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/3-define-tables/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/3-define-tables/solution.pact)

:::

:::info

Table definitions are covered in the
[Pact Schemas and Tables Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/schemas-and-tables#define-tables).

:::

## 4. Define Consts

The loans smart contract contains a few **const** values that will be used to
pass values into functions and tables.

The purpose of each of these constants will be more clear as you begin
integrating them into functionality of your contract using functions. For now,
complete the challenge to define the constants within your smart contract.

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to define each of the const values INITIATED and ASSIGNED in
the loans smart contract.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/4-define-consts/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/4-define-consts/solution.pact)

:::

:::info

Constant definitions are covered in the documentation
[here](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-reference.html#defconst).

:::

## 5. Functions

When working with tables, there are four useful types of functions that you’ll
be using in your smart contract.

| type              | purpose                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Utility Functions | Perform routine operations callable by other functions. |
| Insert Functions  | Insert new rows into a table.                           |
| Update Functions  | Update values within a table.                           |
| Read Functions    | Read values from a table.                               |

The functions you’ll create in the loans smart contract will use combinations of
these built in functions to insert, update, and read data from the tables in
your smart contract.

:::info

You can review each of these function types in the
[Pact Schemas and Tables Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/schemas-and-tables#table-builtin-functions).

:::

### Utility Functions

Your first function will be a utility function meant to help combine the
parameters into an inventory key.

#### 5.1 Inventory-key

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **inventory-key** that creates a key from the **owner**
and **loanId** in the format **“loanId:owner”**.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.1-inventory-key/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.1-inventory-key/solution.pact)

:::

The reason for starting with this function is so that you can use it as a tool
as you progress through other functions in the smart contract.

:::info Hint

Try using the
[format](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-functions.html#format)
function to combine inputs into a string.

:::

### Insert and Update Functions

The following 3 functions use a combination of read, insert, and update to add
and update data in each of the tables you created. These functions will allow
your users to accomplish important tasks like creating a loan, assigning a loan,
and selling a loan.

#### 5.2 Create-a-loan

First, you’ll need to create a function to create a loan.

Creating a loan can be done by populating specific columns with the appropriate
loan data. Take a look at the tables below to see each of the columns that you
will insert data into.

**loans-table**

| column-name | value      |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| loanName    | loanName   |
| entityName  | entityName |
| loanAmount  | loanAmount |
| Status      | INITIATED  |

**loan-inventory-table**

| column-name | value      |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| balance     | loanAmount |

:::caution Code Challenge

Given these requirements, construct a function named **create-a-loan** that
accepts parameters **loanId**, **loanName**, **entityName**, and **loanAmount**
to add the appropriate information to each table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.2-create-a-loan/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.2-create-a-loan/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.3 Assign-a-loan

Now that you can create a loan, it is important to be able to assign that loan
to a specific entity when needed.

To do that, you will both collect data from inputs and read existing data from
tables. Using the combination of this data, you can then assign a loan and
update the appropriate data.

For the **loans-table**, you will need to both read and update data using the
correct built-in functions.

**loans-table**

| column                       | function | source      |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| “entityName”:= entityName    | read     | loans-table |
| “loanAmount”:= issuerBalance | read     | loans-table |
| “status”: ASSIGNED           | update   | loanId      |

For the loan-history-table, you will need to insert data from inputs and data
that is read from other tables.

**loan-history-table**

| column               | function | source      |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| “loanId”: loanId     | insert   | input       |
| “buyer”: buyer       | insert   | input       |
| “seller”: entityName | insert   | loans-table |
| “amount”: amount     | insert   | input       |

The loan-inventory-table will have new data added and updated as needed.

**loan-inventory-table**

| column                              | function | source        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| “balance”: amount                   | insert   | inventory-key |
| “balance”: (- issuerBalance amount) | update   | inventory-key |

:::caution Code Challenge

This code challenge is complex, so take your time and don’t worry if you get
stuck. Follow each line as shown and try to construct the functionality needed
to **assign-a-loan**.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.3-assign-a-loan/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.3-assign-a-loan/solution.pact)

:::

:::info Hint

Break up the needs of each table into separate functions. This will help you
read, insert, and update data in the appropriate order.

:::

#### 5.4 Sell-a-loan

The goal of the next function is similar to allow users to sell a loan. This
function create a new row in the loan-history-table. This time, there is no
table provided to help guide you. Try creating one for yourself if it is useful
or follow the comments to complete the challenge.

:::caution Code Challenge

This is another difficult problem. Take your time and leverage what you learned
in the previous section to help create this function.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.4-sell-a-loan/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.4-sell-a-loan/solution.pact)

:::

:::info Hint

Consult the documentation and **Schema and Tables** tutorial for guidance on
built-in functions like bind, insert, with-read, and others.

:::

### Read Functions

The next set of functions will allow you to **read** important information from
the tables you created. These functions are much shorter than previous functions
and the comments within the challenge files are hopefully enough to get you
started.

#### 5.5 read-a-loan

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-a-loan** that returns the values at a given
loanId.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.5-read-a-loan/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.5-read-a-loan/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.6 read-loan-tx

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-loan-tx** that reads loan txids.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.6-read-loan-tx/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.6-read-loan-tx/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.7 read-all-loans

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-all-loans** that selects all values from the
loans table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.7-read-all-loans/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.7-read-all-loans/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.8 read-inventory-pair

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-inventory-pair** that reads the balance of a
given key.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.8-read-inventory-pair/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.8-read-inventory-pair/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.9 read-loan-inventory

:::warning Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-loan-inventory** that reads the
loan-inventory-table.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.9-read-loan-inventory/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.9-read-loan-inventory/solution.pact)

:::

#### 5.10 read-loans-with-status

:::caution Code Challenge

Create a function named **read-loans-with-status** that reads all loans with a
specific status.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.10-read-loans-with-status/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/5-functions/5.10-read-loans-with-status/solution.pact)

:::

### 6. Create Tables

Earlier in the smart contract, you defined 3 schemas and tables. Now that the
module is complete, you are ready to move outside of the module to create each
of these tables.

:::caution Code Challenge

Take some time now to create each of the tables for the loans smart contract.

- [Challenge](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/6-create-tables/challenge.pact)
- [Solution](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang.org-code/blob/master/loans/2-challenges/6-create-tables/solution.pact)

:::

:::info

Table creation is covered in the
[Tables and Schemas Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/schemas-and-tables#create-tables).

:::

### Deploy the Smart Contract

Congratulations, at this point you have completed the Loans smart contract!

If you’d like, you can try deploying this smart contract. You can deploy this
contract using the **Pact Onine Editor** or from the **Pact Atom SDK**. If you
choose to deploy this locally, you’ll need the REPL file which you can find
inside of the repository you cloned.

For help getting started and deploying in each of these environments, try the
following tutorials.

- [Pact Online Editor](/docs/pact/beginner/web-editor)
- [Pact Development on Atom SDK Tutorial](/docs/pact/beginner/atom-sdk)

## Review

That wraps up this tutorial on the Loans app.

By completing this tutorial, you’ve mastered many of the core ideas surrounding
modules, schemas, tables, and functions, to tackle unfamiliar problems in new
ways. Not only that, you’ve put each of these ideas into practice to create a
smart contract that solves a very complex real world problem.

The same ideas you learned here can be applied to many other industries. Having
the ability to create tables and manipulate data to create useful applications
encompasses everything it means to build the back end of a blockchain
application using Pact.
