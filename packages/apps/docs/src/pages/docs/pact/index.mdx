## What is Pact?

Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. It allows anyone to write
clearly, directly and safely onto a blockchain — a true innovation for secure
and simple smart contract development. Pact will enable you to create entirely
new business models and on-chain services.

## How to use the Pact Developer Tutorials

Pact Developer Tutorials offer the training needed to learn the Pact programming
language. They teach skills from beginner to advanced that are designed to help
you develop blockchain applications with Pact.

## Prerequisites

These free tutorials have no prerequisites. Learn whenever and however you want
using the documentation and complimentary videos for each lesson.

Start with our [Beginner Tutorial Series](/docs/pact/beginner) which covers
Pact’s fundamental concepts, followed by real smart contract projects you can
deploy to our Testnet. Also, the
[Real World Pact](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/real-world-pact) series
contains tutorials and commented Pact code demonstrating how to write real-world
smart contracts including a testnet faucet and a DeFi lending platform.
