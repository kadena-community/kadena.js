Welcome! Kadena Public LLC (“Kadena”, “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides its
services through its website located at kadena.io (collectively the “Services”
or “Chainweaver”).

Before using our Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the
“Agreement”) carefully, along with any other policies or notices on Kadena’s
website, and our Privacy Policy. Together, these materials contain terms,
conditions, rules, and guidelines related to your use of Chainweaver.

OVERVIEW This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this
Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting
all of the terms and conditions and not just this section.

Chainweaver provides self-hosted wallet services for Kadena-based blockchains.

By creating or importing a wallet, or visiting our website, you are agreeing to
our Terms, so please read them carefully.

These terms outline approved uses of Chainweaver, various licenses that we grant
to you, and licenses that you grant us.

If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us
a message at chainweaver@kadena.io. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, AS
AMENDED OR MODIFIED BY US, YOU CANNOT USE CHAINWEAVER OR THE SERVICES.

HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY By creating or importing a locally hosted wallet (a
“Wallet”), or visiting our website, you acknowledge that you have read,
understood, and agreed to these Terms, as well as the accompanying Privacy
Policy(/privacy-policy). By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or
clicking to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available,
you (1) accept and agree to these Terms, (2) consent to the collection, use,
disclosure and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Policy
and (3) agree to any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation
issued by Kadena from time to time. If you do not agree to the Terms, then you
may not access or use the Services or Chainweaver Wallet.

We reserve the right to amend, change or modify these Terms at any time. Any
such changes with respect to your use of Chainweaver will take effect
immediately when posted on our website. Your continued use of Chainweaver
following any such change will signify your acceptance to be bound by the then
current Terms. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have
been any changes since you have last reviewed these Terms.

If you do not agree to this Agreement or any amendments, changes or
modifications to this Agreement, you cannot use the Services or Chainweaver.

Failure or delay by Kadena in enforcing or partially enforcing any provision of
these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights.

ELIGIBILITY To be eligible to use Chainweaver, you must be at least eighteen
(18) years old and be able to form legally binding contracts.

If you are using our Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent
and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing
under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you
are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.

You can only use our Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction.
Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and
regulations that apply to you. KADENA ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY, DUTY OR
LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY BREACH OF LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS BY YOU OR
APPLICABLE TO YOU.

By using Chainweaver, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility
requirements that we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to allow
certain people access or use Chainweaver, and we reserve the right to change our
eligibility criteria at any time, all in our sole and absolute discretion.

THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES Chainweaver is software that (a) generates Wallet
addresses that, can be stored in encrypted storage, that you may use to send and
receive Kadena coins and related cryptographically secured tokens (the
“Tokens”); (b) facilitates the submission of Token transaction data to
Kadena-based blockchains (the “Kadena Networks”); and (c) facilitates the
deployment of and interaction with smart contracts to Kadena Networks.

Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of
certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in
Keystore JSON format. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and,
together,

they can be used to authorize the transfer of Tokens to and from that Wallet
address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private
key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep
your Wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access
information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Tokens
associated with the Wallet.

Chainweaver Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. Chainweaver stores your
Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted
private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated
with your

Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We
cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your
original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address
and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that
any Tokens you have associated with such a Wallet address will become
inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.

Token Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Token transactions
must be confirmed and recorded in the Token’s associated public blockchain. Such
networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third
parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the
Kadena Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction
details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By
using Chainweaver, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you
submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Kadena
Networks.

Chainweaver Wallet Does Not Store or Transmit Tokens. We do not store, send, or
receive Tokens. Any transfer of Tokens that occurs does so on a network that is
not controlled by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Chainweaver Wallet can
affect the transfer of title or right in any Token.

Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any
information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept
and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you
make in

connection with any Token transaction initiated via the Services and with any
smart contract, including any public, private or encrypted data and information,
with which you might interact, modify or create. We strongly encourage you to
review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Token
as well as to review any smart contract or program code before attempting to
deploy or interact with them.

WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION You must either import or create a
Wallet in order to use Chainweaver. When you create a Wallet, you will be
assigned a private key. You will be responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your private key and keystore, and will be fully responsible
for any and all activities that occur under your account.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply
with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take
precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet.

Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating
a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service;
(b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your
private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all
users, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup
functionality; and (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the
private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for
example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet.

Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we
cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Chainweaver
has no control over any Kadena Network and does not have the ability to
facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you
have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions
before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be
liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated
with your Chainweaver account.

Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the
transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services,
and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the
appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining
whether taxes apply to your Kadena-based transactions or for collecting,
reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Token-related
transactions.

THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT In no event shall a description or reference to
a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a
description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or
promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the
exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any third party
product or service.

We do not control, verify, endorse, or adopt any third party content shared
through push notifications or otherwise, and will have no responsibility for any
third party content including, but not limited to, Token availability and/or
sales.

If, to the extent permitted by Chainweaver, you grant express permission to a
third party to access or connect to your Chainweaver account, either through the
third party’s product or service or through Chainweaver, you acknowledge that
granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf
does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You
are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access
to your Chainweaver account.

GOVERNING LAW; FORUM SELECTION No matter where you’re located, the laws of the

all issues relating to arbitrability or the enforcement of the agreement to
arbitrate contained in this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). If any provisions of these Terms are
inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or
modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. Subject to the
duty to arbitrate set forth below, you and Kadena each irrevocably agree to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts sitting in
the State of Delaware in respect of any claim, dispute or controversy arising
out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of these Terms.
Kadena and you irrevocably waive any objection based on lack of personal
jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any
such action.

NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS If you are a user accessing or using our Services

collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be

for in our Privacy Policy.

TERMINATION In the event of termination concerning your license to use
Chainweaver, your obligations under this Agreement will survive as necessary
appropriate under applicable law. Your access to the funds in your Wallet after
termination will depend on your access to your backup of your Wallet address and
private key.

DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to
you, with or without prior notice, and at any time, modify or discontinue,
temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely
responsible for storing outside of the Services a backup of any Wallet address
and private key pair that you maintain in your Wallet.

Maintaining an external backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs
associated with your Wallet will allow you to access the Kadena Networks upon
which your Wallet is secured. Such a backup will allow the user to fully restore
their Wallet at any time without cost or loss of the user’s Token. If you do not
maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will be not
be able to access the Token associated with your Wallet. Chainweaver shall not
be held responsible or liable for any loss of Token in the event that we
discontinue or depreciate the Services.

privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any other
or further

exercise thereof.

SEVERABILITY If any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason
unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to
the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term will not
affect any other terms.

ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL & CLASS ACTION

The parties agree to arbitrate any claim, dispute or controversy arising from or
relating to this Agreement or your use of the Services solely on an individual
basis, and such arbitration shall be the exclusive forum for resolving any and
all such claims, disputes or controversies. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING
IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL
BY JURY. The parties agree that: (a) the arbitration will be binding, (b) any
arbitration will occur in New York, New York; and (c) the arbitration will be
conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of
American Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes,
in the English language, and with limited discovery. At your and our request,
hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may
provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings.
Other than class action and related procedures and remedies discussed below, the
arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
available to a court or other tribunal, subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND REASONABLE
ATTORNEYS' FEES. JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, NEITHER
YOU NOR KADENA WILL COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS
ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU AND
KADENA EACH AGREE NOT TO COMMENCE ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING INCONSISTENT WITH THE
TERMS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.

FORCE MAJEURE We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in
performance, or interruptions of service which result directly or indirectly
from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not
limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military
authorities, act of terrorism, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor
dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or
network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other
catastrophe, or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and
shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

ASSIGNMENT You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer,
sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations under these Terms. Your
agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or
delegate any of your rights or duties under this Agreement, in whole or in part,
to any person, entity or other party. Any transfer, assignment or delegation in
breach or violation of this Section shall be void.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and
agreement as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior
discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including, without
limitation, any prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us.
Except for Kadena’s right change these Terms at any time, as set forth above,
any amendment or modification to this Agreement must be in writing and must be
signed by both parties.
