description:
  Pact makes designing safer smart contracts effortless, whether you’re writing
  your first contract or launching your fiftieth dApp. It’s fundamentally
  different from other contract languages. It’s readable by non-developers. It
  automatically detects bugs, freeing you from the exploits you’ll face on
  Ethereum and other unsafe platforms. And it has been battle-tested in
  production applications for over two years.
