### 1. Chainweb, Kadena’s (layer 1) public blockchain protocol

Chainweb is a braided, parallelized proof-of-work consensus mechanism that
improves throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and integrity
found in Bitcoin.

In 2020, Kadena's public blockchain performed a live network expansion from 10
chains to 20 chains. This doubled throughput, proving the network's ability to
scale in production to meet ever-higher demand.
