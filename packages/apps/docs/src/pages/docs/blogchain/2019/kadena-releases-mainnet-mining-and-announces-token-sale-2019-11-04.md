# Kadena Releases Mainnet Mining and Announces Token Sale

Kadena’s mainnet is now fully accessible for public mining. The release provides
miners with the opportunity to solve blocks on Kadena’s public blockchain.
People can also watch the mining of the parallel chains through Kadena’s
[Block Explorer](https://explorer.chainweb.com/), a tool that allows for
tracking in real-time.

“Since the inception of Kadena, we’ve maintained the vision of getting tech
problems out of the way of blockchain adoption,” said Will Martino, CEO and
Founder of Kadena. “We address scalability and security, and yet these are just
the hurdles that exist today. Tomorrow will bring new challenges, and Kadena
will be there to solve them.”

The usability of our public blockchain, paired with the scalability of our
private blockchain, realizes Kadena’s goal of a hybrid network designed for
interoperability and security. Our network — built on the proven stability of
Proof of Work and the ease of the Pact smart contract language — delivers an
ecosystem that other blockchains are just beginning to build.

Read on to learn the details of the mainnet mining release, the announcement of
our token sale, and Kadena’s Block Explorer.

## Delivering the Blockchain of Tomorrow, Today

It’s easy to mine the Kadena public blockchain.
[Run a full node](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/blob/master/README.md)
and use our dedicated
[mining client](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/tree/master/miner).
Please refer to our
[Chainweb Wiki](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/wiki) and our
[FAQs](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/wiki/Chainweb-FAQ) for help
with mining. You may also join
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bsUcWmX?utm_source=tropyc) to ask
questions.

Kadena’s public blockchain will continue using a Proof of Work consensus
mechanism. Proof of Work allows Kadena to build upon the success of Bitcoin and
addresses the known challenges of speed and scalability by using parallel
braided chains.

Additionally, Kadena verifies the legitimacy of transactions, prevents
double-spending, and rewards miners for the computational effort associated with
each block solved. To encourage steady growth of the network, Kadena’s public
blockchain will continue to use Blake2s as its primary hash function and support
CPU mining. As a best practice, miners are encouraged to run a node on a
personal, public IP address.

The majority of the coins in the Kadena economy are mining rewards because the
network relies on decentralized mining for functionality and growth. Miners
receive block rewards for validation/production of blocks. The block reward will
be in the platform’s native cryptocurrency, Kadena (KDA). Miners will also be
able to receive KDA as transaction fees or gas payments for the execution of
smart contracts. The minimum fractional unit of KDA is a “Hop,” a trillionth,
named after Grace Hopper.

Kadena is already delivering features today that other blockchains have only
begun to include on their roadmaps, including Formal Verification,
interoperability, scalability, and more. The journey started with Kadena’s
founders creating JPMorgan’s first blockchain, which laid the groundwork for
Kadena’s smart contract language, Pact. Pact is open source and was designed
with ease-of-use in mind for both developers and business professionals.

We’ve released
[Pact 3.1](https://medium.com/kadena-io/pact-3-1-is-unleashed-ebfddfb648ce) and
received a grant from the Interchain Foundation to implement
[Kadenamint for the Cosmos ecosystem](https://medium.com/kadena-io/introducing-kadenamint-and-chainweb-testnet-v2-cde077c02ebc).
Along the way, we’ve appreciated the feedback from our community. Now, we offer
an invitation.

Kadena’s token sale will go live on [CoinList](http://coinlist.co/kadena)
starting November 5th at 12:00 PM PST. Registration has already begun. To
participate in the token sale, visit
[coinlist.co/kadena](http://coinlist.co/kadena).

_CoinList is currently the sole authorized partner to issue Kadena coins. Kadena
will only communicate through official channels (our website, emails from
kadena.io, and the social media links at the bottom of our site). Beware of
phishing and scam attempts._

## Create Your Own Smart Contracts with Our Testnet Portal

Our [Testnet Portal](http://testnet.chainweb.com/) is a one-stop shop where you
can download our testnet wallet, get testnet coins, play a game, and have fun
interacting with our blockchain!

**Get Coins (Kadena Testnet Faucet)**

The Testnet Faucet allows you to create, fund, and check the balance of your
account. This is also a great way to get started interacting with our blockchain
by creating and testing your own smart contracts before the December launch of
our hybrid blockchain platform.

**Roll the Dice with Pacty Parrots!**

A fun way to interact with and see all the features of our blockchain without
writing any code is by playing our Pacty Parrots Game. Play to see if you land
on a Guy Fieri to win the jackpot! The game does not use any form of currency
and is solely for recreation.

**Takeaways:**

- The signing API simulates exactly how signing for transactions is going to
  work in Kadena’s public blockchain through our testnet wallet

- The wallet showcases the ease of using our
  [pact-lang-api](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang-api) to read and write
  data from a Pact smart contract

## Explore Blocks in Real-Time with Block Explorer

![](/assets/blog/2019/1_gf6Csh42f-b_REgXgnO7Fw.webp)

Along with the release of mainnet comes Kadena’s
[Block Explorer](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet), a new tool that allows
miners to navigate the public blockchain. Miners can view blocks getting added
in real-time while exploring the blocks for key details such as block height,
PoW Hash, neighbors, and payload.

## Rebranding of Some Kadena Products

The continuing development of our blockchain platform brings new names for some
of our products. Our private blockchain, originally referred to as
[ScalableBFT](https://medium.com/kadena-io/scalablebft-kadenas-private-blockchain-101-c99895c0fd50),
will now be known as _Kadena Kuro_. Our public blockchain, which began as
[Chainweb](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadena-public-blockchain-releases-fully-public-testnet-v3-hashing-algorithm-and-mining-api-e230a51c7b26?source=collection_home---5------2-----------------------),
has been simplified to just _Kadena_ or _Kadena’s public blockchain_.

There’s more to look forward to on Kadena’s roadmap before the year ends,
including the full launch of Kadena’s hybrid blockchain platform. Keep in touch
with Kadena through
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bsUcWmX?utm_source=tropyc) or by
