# USCF Collaborates with Kadena on Use of Blockchain in Investment Space

_New York, NY — May 13, 2019_

**[US Commodities Fund](http://www.uscfinvestments.com) Investments (USCF)**, a
leading and innovative provider of commodities and alternative investment
products, today announced that it is collaborating with
**[Kadena](http://kadena.io)**, the first blockchain technology company to come
out of JP Morgan’s Blockchain Center for Excellence.

USCF is known as an early pioneer of ETPs, bringing previously difficult to
access asset classes to all investors. The firm broke new ground with the launch
of the first oil ETP, the United States Oil Fund, LP (USO), in 2006. Over the
next decade, USCF designed and issued fifteen more ETPs and ETFs, across
commodity and equity asset classes.

“We see the potential to leverage blockchain in the investment space and
identify new opportunities for innovation in asset management,” said
[John Love](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=22496828&privcapId=324407470),
President and CEO of USCF. “Kadena has solved scalability and security
constraints previously associated with blockchains to offer exciting potential
applications.”

Kadena’s hybrid (public and permissioned) blockchain platform was purpose-built
to address the scale, security, speed, and ease of use requirements of
industrial infrastructure. Kadena’s open source smart contract language Pact is
unique in being simple and intuitive for both developers and business
professionals, while also supporting the Formal Verification of users’ code.

“At Kadena, we build our partnerships with a focus on production-ready solutions
to real problems in the financial markets,” said
[Will Martino](https://twitter.com/_wjmartino_), Founder & CEO of Kadena, who
has regulatory experience as the former Tech Lead for the U.S. Securities &
Exchange Commission’s Cryptocurrency Steering Committee. “We are proud to
collaborate with USCF in the investment space. USCF has a history of diligent,
creative leadership and I see them as financial services market leaders who
share our vision of delivering everyday uses of blockchain.”
