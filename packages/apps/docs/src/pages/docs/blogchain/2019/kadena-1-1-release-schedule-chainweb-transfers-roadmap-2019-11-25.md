# Kadena 1.1 Release Schedule/Chainweb Transfers Roadmap

_**12/4/19 Update:** Thank you to one of our community members who has
identified a potential security vulnerability. Coming back from the Thanksgiving
holiday, our team investigated this yesterday and has confirmed that it needs to
be addressed. Since we want to be cautious and diligent about preserving network
stability and token value, we are moving the date of enabling token transfers to
**December 17**. Please visit Kadena’s

As part of our ongoing efforts to keep the community informed, we are sharing
the release schedule for Kadena 1.1, which enables coin transfers on the Kadena
public blockchain. After the initial release, the transition from version 1.0.5
to 1.1 will take place over three stages from December 2 to December 6, 2019,
followed by a ramp-up period of transfer volume.

## Kadena 1.1 Software Release (December 2):

- Kadena 1.1 is required to operate the blockchain after the rollover is
  complete.

- It contains the necessary protocol changes to allow coin transfers on the
  platform.

- It also contains important improvements and fixes for the protocol, P2P layer,
  transfer performance, and stability.

## Soft Rollover Stage (December 2–5):

- Kadena versions 1.0.5 and 1.1 are both fully operational and cross-compatible.

- Both versions continue to mine empty blocks only (no transfers).

- Miners are encouraged to update as soon as possible so we can address any
  unforeseen issues with the upgrade in the soft rollover stage.

## Hard Rollover Stage (December 5–6):

- All Kadena versions 1.0.x will stop mining new blocks at 00:00 UTC December 5.
  Miners will have to upgrade at this point to keep mining.

- Kadena version 1.1 will continue to mine empty blocks as before.

## Kadena 1.1 Transfers Enabled (December 6):

- At the end of the hard rollover stage, the Kadena blockchain will start
  accepting coin transfers and other coin-related operations.

- We will provide documentation on methods for performing transfers.

## Transfer Limit Ramp-up

Building on the success of the limited beta release on October 30, the Kadena
1.1 blockchain will gradually ramp up transfer throughput over the following
weeks after December 6, so we can continue to address issues that might arise
with the new functionality.

On December 6, Kadena 1.1 will have a low gas limit that defaults to
approximately 10 transfers per block. We plan to increase this limit
periodically with close coordination with the mining community on an
approximately weekly basis. Initial increases will result in block transfer
limits of 25, 50, etc. We expect to continually release upgrades during this
time to improve transfer handling and enable greater throughput.
