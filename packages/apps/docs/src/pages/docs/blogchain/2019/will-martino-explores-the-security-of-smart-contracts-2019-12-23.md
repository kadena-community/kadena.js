# Will Martino Explores the Security of Smart Contracts

This past June, Kadena Founder and CEO, Will Martino, was invited to speak at
Consensus 2019. While speaking on the panel on ‘Why Blockchain Privacy Matters
to the Enterprise,’ Will discussed the benefits of a hybrid blockchain platform
and smart contract technology.

Will shared a specific example in which the entity managing transactions on a
private blockchain is a large healthcare company. On the healthcare company’s
private blockchain is HIPAA-compliant data, and at some level, this blockchain
holds the social security number of a particular patient. The consensus region
of the private chain is linked to a public chain where a smart contract is
available to both the healthcare company and the patient.

At some point in this example, the patient needs to share their personal
information with a specialist that the healthcare company has prompted them to
contact. Using the smart contract available on the public chain, the healthcare
company and patient can guarantee sharing the correct information to the
designated third-party through a simple on-chain authorization.

How can this technology be considered ‘simple’ when smart contract languages
have traditionally have been difficult to read without a developer background?
Observing how this is a widespread challenge in blockchain, Kadena designed its
smart contract language, Pact. By keeping ease of use in mind, Kadena built Pact
as human-readable for use by both business professionals and developers. The
simplicity of guaranteeing a smart contract’s completion comes from the ability
of a participant to verify the instructions included in the request. When
everyone can understand what information is being exchanged, transactions become
more secure and trustless.

As Will stated during his panel,

> “Data is going to become a liability…and that’s going to be the pressure that
> pushes big corporations to care about the privacy of their data…and make sure
> that even if they get hacked, the data doesn’t leak out.”

Kadena has designed its hybrid blockchain and the Pact smart contract language
to address the needs of how data gets shared today, as well as the challenges
that have come along with it. There’s more to look forward to on
[Kadena’s roadmap](/docs/blogchain/2019/roadmap-for-kadenas-hybrid-blockchain-launch-in-january-2020-2019-12-04)
going into next year, including the full launch of Kadena’s hybrid blockchain
platform. Keep in touch with Kadena through
