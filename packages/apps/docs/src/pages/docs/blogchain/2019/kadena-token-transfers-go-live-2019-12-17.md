# Kadena Token Transfers Go Live

Today, Kadena has begun enabling Kadena (KDA) token transfers. Since we
announced mining to our community on October 30, the network has experienced
significant growth. As of December 17, we have seen over
[1,000,000 blocks mined](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet) by more than
10,000 GPUs (at an average hash rate between 10–15 TH/second). Now, tokens
earned by miners are transferable from and to other people (peer-to-peer). Token
transfers represent the second stage towards the full launch of Kadena’s hybrid
blockchain platform and Pact smart contract transactions early next year.

## **Token Transfers Enabled on December 17**

The Kadena blockchain will begin accepting token transfers and other
token-related operations starting at 16:00:00 UTC December 17. All Kadena
versions prior to 1.4 will stop mining new blocks at 00:00 UTC December 17**.**
To keep mining, participants will have to upgrade their Kadena Chainweb version
to the latest version.

To easily execute transfers yourself, download Kadena’s smart contract wallet
for the Mac OS, Chainweaver Beta, [here](https://www.kadena.io/chainweaver). For
non-Mac users, a portal for submitting transfers is
[available here](https://kadena-community.github.io/kadena-transfer-js/).

## **Transfer Limit Ramp-up**

The [Kadena 1.4 release](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/releases)
will gradually ramp up transfer throughput over the weeks following December 17,
so that we can take a deliberate approach to network stability.

On December 17, Kadena 1.4 will have a gas limit that defaults to approximately
ten transfers per block with steady increases in capacity throughout December.
We plan to increase this limit periodically in close coordination with the
mining community. Initial increases will result in block transfer limits of 25,
50, etc. We expect to continually release upgrades during this time to improve
transfer handling and enable greater throughput.

Alongside the activation of token transfers, we’re introducing additional
functionality. This includes:

- Finalizing the Pact gas model

- Supporting fully-autonomous managed capabilities in Pact

- Improving Pact natives’ performance and benchmarking

- An updated Mining API that allows for even faster work updates

Leading up to the January launch of our hybrid blockchain platform, Kadena will
keep miners informed of the latest network upgrades. For those wanting to
participate in Kadena’s public blockchain now, an
[FAQ](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/wiki/Chainweb-FAQ) is available
on our GitHub.
