## Meet The Kadena Team: Founder & President, Stuart Popejoy

_Learn about his love for Algorithmic Music Compositions, why we’re still in the
dark age of software development, and where blockchain will be in 10–20 years._

### What personal projects do you pursue outside of work?

Music is arguably my other life — except that they do collide sometimes, namely
in algorithmic compositions where I’ve written pieces using Java or Haskell
code. I’ve played instruments my whole life (I started with the piano) and there
are always more projects and bands than free time.

There’s a notion that software development and music go together often, and
while I’m not sure that’s precisely true, I really appreciate the embrace of
abstraction that you find in modern compositional techniques. For example, the
use of set theory, and also in the ways that compositional techniques
historically prefigure concepts in math such as inversion and retrograde (see
Bach’s compositions).

I say “arguably” because while I do work with professional musicians, release
albums, etc., I don’t come close to having music being my livelihood. In that
sense, I’m all about tech.

**What do you enjoy about the work you do?**

I’m going to use this question to instead focus on one specific aspect of our
work at Kadena, which is to make Formal Verification a useable technology for
average developers and business professionals. The context is thatPact, our
smart contract language, allows a developer to add statements that the computer
will try to prove wrong. For example, “it’s impossible to spend a token twice,”
or, “a person’s age can never decrease.”

There really are some ways that we are still in the dark ages when it comes to
how we build software, and we all really feel it. Whenever there is a big hack
of user accounts at some company, or when a program we use every day stops
working for some basic task.

Formal Verification has been around for decades but it is so hard to use that it
only comes out for nuclear reactor control systems, chip design, or some other
super-wizzy and safety-critical work. In the future, computers will find the
bugs for us, and Pact’s Formal Verification system is a preview of that happy
day, at least for software developers.

**Why does blockchain matter?**

For me, blockchain provides a way to solve fundamental problems in how we use
technology to make things work better. Take smart contracts: the idea that you
can power a business on a blockchain by capturing the essence of its workflows
and transactions, without having to worry about system crashes and specialized
software. It is just incredibly powerful to me.

Games have done this, where user mods turn into full-fledged online games.
There’s no way a mod can crash the game itself. With blockchain, we take this
idea to the very core of how we interact with each other as autonomous
individuals, and the trust comes from the robustness of the platform itself.
I’ve been building transactional computer systems for almost two decades, and
the elegance of a blockchain solution is very compelling for me as both a user
and a technology provider.

**If the blockchain really is as revolutionary as the web, what will it mean for
everyday consumers in a decade or two?**

I think a lot of the pain points we experience today will largely disappear, at
least as much as security is concerned. Blockchain, as long as we don’t let IBM
or R3 define what blockchain means and stick to the Bitcoin/Ethereum definition,
represents a huge leap forward in security. We can put these huge password
breaches that plague us, with a new breach seemingly every week, behind us with
secure wallets in our pockets that simply cannot be stolen (although they can be
lost).

We can look forward to a world where the web is no longer driven by advertising
and personal data mining, but instead by the intrinsic value of the things we do
every day to naturally power the online economy. We all win with a true
diversity of direct interaction business models in online form, finally powered
by more than just clicks and views.
