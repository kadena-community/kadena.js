In late September, Kadena leadership spoke at the World Blockchain Forum, a
global conference dedicated to furthering the discussion on blockchain
technology, trends, and applications.

The conference identified several advancements and opportunities for blockchain
in fintech. Kadena Founders
[Stuart Popejoy](https://twitter.com/sirlensalot?lang=en) and
[Will Martino](https://twitter.com/_wjmartino_?lang=en) spoke on two separate
panels to share their views on blockchain’s application in financial services
and larger industry trends.

One of the panel topics, “Blockchain & Fintech Industry Trends,” addressed the
difficulties of navigating real business use cases, which often experience
challenges concerning government regulation, user trust, and ease of use.

On the key to blockchain adoption, Will Martino said,

> “One of the things that is going to be required to have a real business use
> case is a platform where you can build real technology. The next platform that
> can actually demonstrate real business use cases, in a way that is compliant,
> is one that people are going to flock towards.”

A second panel covered blockchain applications in financial services. Naturally,
venture capital was addressed in the discussion, as VC funding plays a large
role in the development of blockchain technology. Stuart took the chance to
acknowledge venture funding’s limitations that can complicate the relationship
between funding and blockchain technology.

Despite some of the hurdles with fintech, both Stuart and Will agree that
solutions are within reach. In the years to come, blockchain technology will be
at the forefront of change.
