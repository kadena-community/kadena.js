# Kadena: New Look, Same Mission

### A review of our rebranded look

You might have noticed a change in our look, feel, and logo recently across a
few of our [social media](http://twitter.com/kadena_io) platforms and
[website](http://kadena.io). Kadena has grown a lot across a number of fronts:
as a team (from four to twenty-four full employees in the last year!), as a
community (we held [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/kadena/) in Asia and across
North America, and partnered with [Alteum](http://alteum.io) in Latin America),
and as a holistic blockchain platform, from a purely enterprise blockchain
reflecting our JP Morgan roots, to a hybrid blockchain platform with an
integrated, open-source smart contract language.

Our brand reflects our belief that blockchain is a technology and way of
thinking that will fundamentally transform business, finance, government and
society. **Kadena is here to make sure this happens**, with technology featuring
unmatched speed, scale, security, and simplicity. We’re here to inspire our
partners to take their ideas and ambitions to places none of us can even imagine
yet.

**This is an incredible time for us. **We’re working with some of the world’s
best engineers to solve challenges and unleash opportunities across wildly
varied industries and geographies. We’re doing the tough, exhilarating work of
dramatically boosting blockchain adoption, functionality, and ease of use.

As we accomplish all this, the Kadena brand is as vital to our success as our
technology. Our brand is a living thing, capable of growing organically and
flexibly as we do, while maintaining a unified look, feel and voice. We’ve
worked closely with our branding specialist
**[Keith Venkiteswaran](https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=UVlZNHRZbkVnZ3N4VzQ5ZXliQmZwdz09)**
to show you how we think about and implement our identity to stay consistent —
while always being open to what’s new, fresh, energizing and relevant.

Practically speaking, the new branding does a number of things, including:

- **Frees us up from the limited design space of a single color palette:** we’re
  all about building the tools that let people make blockchain applications
  safely and freely — so why limit ourselves?

**Reflects our purpose**: the glow inside our new “K” symbolizes the energy and
innovative ideas within Kadena, with textures and imagery to evoke the
innovative work we’re doing across industries.

- **Keeps things legible**: we have always strived to make our products (like
  our Pact smart contracts) simple and comprehensible, and we believe our
  branding should too.

This year is going to be an exciting year where we bring
[Chainweb](./all-about-chainweb-101-and-faqs-2019-02-01), our public
proof-of-work protocol, into testnet and then launch. You may have checked out
our
**[recent roadmap](./kadenas-roadmap-to-a-hybrid-blockchain-platform-2019-03-14)**,
or heard about our new
**[blockchain-as-a-service on AWS Marketplace](http://fortune.com/2019/01/23/blockchain-aws-kadena/)**.
This is just the beginning, and we’re excited to share the rest of the journey
with you.
