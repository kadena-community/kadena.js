[filling out our 10-question application](https://forms.gle/Sj3oCEmPDhsyAzok8).**
_

The [Kadena](http://kadena.io) team is excited to announce that our scalable
Proof of Work public blockchain will be launching mainnet on October 30, 2019!
We also have updates from our testnet, including an upcoming _whitelist queue_
for miners to participate in our testnet.

### MAINNET LAUNCH DATE — Oct 30, 2019

Mainnet is significant because Kadena is launching the first scalable and secure
Proof of Work blockchain. Kadena Public Mainnet will launch with a braided,
mining-powered, multi-chain environment capable of higher transaction speeds and
greater security than existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### TESTNET v1 MINER WHITELIST — May 30, 2019

After a successful launch of Testnet v0 in March, we are making substantial
updates to push towards v1. Of special interest to our community, we will begin
accepting applications and _approve select external miners into our test
network_. NOTE: *This is NOT pre-mining of the public blockchain. *Miners will
get to learn how our public blockchain works and collaborate with our team to
scale the network. Be part of making history with the first scalable PoW
blockchain!

If you do not get selected as a v1 miner, please be patient. We are working hard
to make Testnet v2 fully public, allowing *anyone *to participate and test-mine
the network.

Below are noted updates to the functionality of
[Testnet](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node) v1:

1.  Fast node restart without having to re-sync old data
2.  Memory-stable execution (persistence)
3.  Bounce network to 20-chain configuration
4.  Contract store for pact.kadena.io
5.  Coin faucet
6.  Cross-chain transfer via Pact SPV
