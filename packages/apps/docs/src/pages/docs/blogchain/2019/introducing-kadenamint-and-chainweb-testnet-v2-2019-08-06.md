# Introducing Kadenamint and Public Blockchain Testnet v2

_Kadena receives grant to deploy Pact smart contract language to Cosmos
ecosystem, updates testnet (v2) with a public binary and dashboard._

August 6, 2019 — New York, NY — The Kadena team is pleased to announce that
[we have received a grant from the Interchain Foundation](https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-will-have-3-coding-languages-heres-why-that-matters-for-ethereum)
to deploy [Pact](https://pactlang.org/) as the first open source smart contract
language with Formal Verification in the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network)
ecosystem. The implementation of Kadena’s smart contract language on the Cosmos
network will be called “Kadenamint.” We have also launched testnet v2 of the
Kadena public blockchain, which includes a monitoring dashboard and public
binaries for miners.

## What is Kadenamint?

**Kadenamint** is the implementation of our smart contract language Pact on
Tendermint, facilitated by the backing and endorsement of a $150,000 grant from
the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io). The Cosmos network runs on
the Tendermint protocol, the only fully open source permissioned blockchain with
a proven consensus protocol. The Tendermint protocol already supports $5 billion
in value from companies like Binance and Cosmos. Kadenamint brings blockchain
developers the
[best smart contract language](./safer-smarter-contracts-with-pact-2019-02-20)
available and further establishes Pact as the industry standard.

## Why is Kadenamint important?

Kadenamint will allow for rapid implementation of apps in a safer way.
Entrepreneurs and enterprises alike will have a configuration-free and
completely open source smart contract language for business applications.
Kadenamint brings the power of user-code
[Formal Verification](/docs/blogchain/2018/pact-formal-verification-for-blockchain-smart-contracts-done-right-2018-05-11),
proper multi-signature features and full capabilities to Tendermint.

## What people are saying about Kadenamint:

“Kadena is bringing a powerful and safety oriented smart contract language with
Pact. Pact is going to be the next standard smart contract language for the
multiparty smart contract workflows that power Defi,” said
**[Zaki Manian](https://twitter.com/zmanian), Executive Director of Trusted IoT
Alliance** and advisor to Cosmos and Tendermint. “The focus on Formal
Verification, a capabilities-based security model, upgradeability and multisig
aligns incredibly well with the design principles of IBC. This integration will
provide Pact authors with billions in assets in the wider Cosmos ecosystem.”

“Kadena and Cosmos share the goal of creating a truly interoperable blockchain
ecosystem,” said **Kadena Founder and CEO
[Will Martino](http://twitter.com/_wjmartino_)**. “Cosmos and Tendermint are
industry leaders in Proof of Stake and we are proud to bring Pact to their
developer community.”

“Pact on Tendermint, Kadenamint, is a meaningful step towards a unified and
secure standard for smart contract languages across blockchain platforms,” said
**[Stuart Popejoy](http://twitter.com/SirLensALot), Kadena Founder and
President**. “Pact’s open source Formal Verification and native multi-signature
features are aligned with the developer-first design principles of Cosmos’
ecosystem.”

## Public Blockchain Testnet v2

In addition to Kadenamint, we are releasing new features in testnet v2 for our
scalable Proof of Work blockchain. The Kadena blockchain becomes faster and more
interoperable with these updates. Testnet v2 includes the following features:

- **Public binary** — **available on our
  [Github](http://kadena.io/testnetbinary).** With this open source binary, you
  can run a single node testnet of the Kadena public blockchain on your Linux
  system. Join our [Discord](http://discord.io/kadena) to meet other testnet
  participants and form a community distributed testnet!

- **Pact checkpoint persistence and replay** — allows for full transaction
  replay from disk on restart.

- **Pact SPV endorsements** — makes it possible to run cross-blockchain
  multi-step transactions with Pact. For instance, a user can specify to send
  their coins to any supported blockchain. This allows the Kadena public
  blockchain to have a single unified currency across all chains, and for Pact
  to support cross-blockchain exchanges.

- **Pact module caching** — reduces the number of database calls significantly,
  improving memory usage, speeding up transaction processing, and decreasing
  network stress.

- **[Public monitoring dashboard](http://kadena.io/dashboard)** — you can now
  monitor our testnet’s progress using [Amberdata](http://amberdata.io/) APIs.
