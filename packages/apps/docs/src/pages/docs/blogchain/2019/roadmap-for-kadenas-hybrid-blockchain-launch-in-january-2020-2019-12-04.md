# Roadmap for Kadena’s Hybrid Blockchain Launch in January 2020

### Reflecting on 2019 and Looking Ahead

As Kadena continues working toward the full launch of our hybrid blockchain
platform in January 2020, we’d like to share the progress we’ve made so far. In
addition to reaching the business and technology milestones following our
[last roadmap update](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadenas-roadmap-to-a-hybrid-blockchain-platform-dc0ff7c178a6),
we have appreciation for the industry-leading conferences and partners that have
collaborated with us because they see the value in Kadena’s hybrid network.
Utilizing Kadena’s open-sourced [Pact](https://pact.kadena.io) smart contract
language (with Formal Verification), our platform will deliver simple and secure
interoperability between both public and permissioned chains. With founders
Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino providing leadership gained from building J.P.
Morgan’s first blockchain, Kadena is solving the scaling challenges of Bitcoin
and the security issues of Ethereum.

[Click here](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadenas-roadmap-to-a-hybrid-blockchain-platform-dc0ff7c178a6)
to visit Kadena’s timeline from founding through to Q1 of 2019.

In April 2019, we passed 10,000 blocks on Kadena Testnet, an early and promising
signal of Kadena’s approach with parallelized Proof of Work on public
blockchain. We also added support for integrated trustless SPV proofs for
cross-chain interactions. Additionally, we released full Formal Verification
coverage of Pact smart contract guards and capabilities.

During Consensus in May, Kadena announced a partnership with $3 billion fund
USCF, a leading asset manager in alternative investments. As USCF is known for
innovation in the financial industry, Kadena is working with them to explore
opportunities for deploying our hybrid blockchain technology to their business.
In addition to presenting at Consensus, Kadena Head of Research and Networks
Monica Quaintance also spoke on stage at _MIT Technology Review_’s Business of
Blockchain conference the same month.

During the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy in Stockholm in June,
Kadena’s Monica Quaintance and Gauntlet Networks Founder & CEO Tarun Chitra
presented peer-reviewed
[research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2019/04/29/high-frequency-trading-researcher-publishes-findings-on-jpmorgan-blockchain-spin-off/#44f7453f2915)
that used agent-based simulations to validate that Kadena’s braided Proof of
Work chains scale securely. On the product side, the company released Simple
Payment Verification (SPV) support and updated Pact to version 3.0 with modular
governance and other features.

During the summer, we released a public monitoring dashboard at the same time as
Kadena Testnet v2. (The testnet dashboard has since been taken down now that we
have a [live block explorer](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet).) Following
up on our
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07MKMKP4F?qid=1574899622437&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title)
listing at the start of the year, we deployed the Kadena Scalable Permissioned
Blockchain to the
[Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/kadenallc.scalablebft).
The team also hosted a Blockchain Summer community event, featuring a panel
discussion about the road to mainstream adoption with thought leaders including
investor Arianna Simpson, Gauntlet’s Tarun Chitra, and Elizabeth Polanco (former
Executive Director of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain payments team). Rounding out the
summer was an announcement that Kadena received a grant from the Interchain
Foundation to integrate Pact with the Cosmos ecosystem, an implementation we’re
calling
[Kadenamint](https://medium.com/kadena-io/introducing-kadenamint-and-chainweb-testnet-v2-cde077c02ebc).

Fall of 2019 brought the beginning of our mainnet rollout. First, we released
Kadena Testnet v3 and revealed our mining hash function (blake2s). Then, as
promised to our mining community, we gave them initial notice of mainnet mining
on October 30. To give community members visibility into block performance and
other metrics, we provided the
[Kadena Block Explorer](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet). To correspond
with mining on Kadena’s mainnet, Anastasia Bez, Will Martino, and Monica
Quaintance published our
[token economics model](https://medium.com/kadena-io/the-kadena-token-economic-model-8090d7545eef).

After mining began, Web3 Foundation and Kadena agreed to explore an
implementation of Pact for the Polkadot ecosystem. Kadena would like to thank
the mining community for all the feedback and support so far. As of December 3,
the network has seen over
[1,000,000 blocks mined](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet) by more than
10,000 GPUs (at an average hash rate between 10–15 TH/second).

To understand more about Kadena’s approach to community mining as a
bootstrapping mechanism,
[please read](https://medium.com/tokendaily/a-look-at-the-kadena-network-launch-c956ea30e07a)
the assessment by Mohamed Fouda of _Token Daily_. In Messari’s
[analysis of our mining release](https://messari.io/article/new-asset-launches-breaking-down-the-launch-strategies-of-kadena-vs-nervos-network),
they found that Kadena “ignited a frenzy among miners to join the network and
develop more advanced mining tools.”

As we approach the close of the year, Kadena Founder and President Stuart
Popejoy has published the
[Kadena 1.1 Release Schedule/Chainweb Transfers Roadmap](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadena-1-1-release-schedule-chainweb-transfers-roadmap-97f29dd5dd33),
a near-term development schedule. He explains that we will start with a low gas
limit that defaults to approximately 10 transfers per block with steady
increases in capacity throughout December. On December 17, the enabling of
Kadena (KDA) token transfers represents the second stage towards completing full
launch. Coins earned by miners will be transferable from and to other people
(peer-to-peer). We will also release a _beta_ version of the Chainweaver wallet.
The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet support will allow people to recover
their keys from a single 12-word recovery phrase.

Thanks again to everyone in our community. Looking ahead to 2020, Kadena will
fully launch our hybrid blockchain platform in January, including Pact smart
contract transactions. For those interested in

Forrester recently published a _Forbes_ article that includes Kadena.
