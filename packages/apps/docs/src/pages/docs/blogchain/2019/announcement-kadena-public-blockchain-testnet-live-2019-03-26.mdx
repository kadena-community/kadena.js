## Announcement: Kadena Public Blockchain Testnet LIVE

Kadena is excited to announce that Chainweb–Kadena’s public proof-of-work
blockchain–is now LIVE in testnet!

_Update: 03/26/19 3:34PM ET: Kadena’s Chainweb testnet is now live in South
America (Brazil), bringing us up to 4 global regions._

**What is Chainweb Testnet?** This version features the core innovation of
Kadena’s Chainweb: multiple, braided proof-of-work chains progressing in
parallel, each referencing its peer chains, synced over four global regions
(Asia, US, EU, LA) to represent a truly distributed, secure, scalable
blockchain.

Chainweb Testnet v0 includes:

- **10 chains** — This is the most innovative and important feature of Chainweb.
  We are testing the security and scalability of braiding multiple Bitcoin-like
  (proof-of-work) chains.

- **Multiple regions** — In order to truly test the speeds of a global network,
  Kadena’s Chainweb Testnet v0 will test global latencies by syncing across
  servers in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe.

- **Fully open source** — Download and test the network yourself
  ([Github](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node)). _If you are setting up
  Chainweb and have questions, head over to #chainweb on
  [our Discord](http://discord.io/kadena)._

- **Process Pact transactions** — Kadena’s open-source
  [Pact](http://github.com/kadena-io/pact) language is easy to learn, and is
  purpose-built for blockchain, capturing simple transactions and more complex
  business workflows; Chainweb v0 intends to support Pact transactions.

**Why is this testnet important?** Kadena is a fundamental believer in the
legacy and integrity of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work protocol. Chainweb is designed
to give blockchain scalability AND security through its multi-chain
configuration; we believe it is the first of its kind. For more about Chainweb,
check out our
[101/FAQ](https://medium.com/kadena-io/all-about-chainweb-101-and-faqs-6bd88c325b45)
and read the [whitepaper](https://kadena.io/docs/chainweb-v15.pdf).

**How can I participate in testnet?** Beginning with v1 and v2, our testnet will
become open to the public to participate in the network. v0 is private but open
source on [Github](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node), so you can look
at the code, compile, and run your own network and tests. *Find something
interesting? [*Let us know](http://discord.io/kadena) in the #chainweb channel).
**Sign up for testnet participation updates via our
[newsletter](http://kadena.io/newsletter).**

**What else is next?** Look forward to our next versions (with weekly updates
all summer) for the following additional upgrades:

- Scaling up (via hard fork) to 20, 50, 100 chains

- Mining client

- Wallets

- More dashboards

- KIPs\*, including: coin contract

\*KIPs (**Kadena Improvement Process**) are modeled after Ethereum and
[Bitcoin’s improvement proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals).
We’ll soon publicize the methods by which our community can introduce and
execute improvements to our protocol.

**Interested in mining Chainweb? **Our next test version aims to have a mining
client, sign up [here](https://upscri.be/26f493/) to get on our Mining Waitlist.
