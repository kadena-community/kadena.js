# Kadena to Explore Implementation of Pact for Polkadot Ecosystem

_Former JP Morgan blockchain team launches feasibility study with Web3
Foundation_

[Kadena](http://www.kadena.io/), the first blockchain technology company to come
out of JP Morgan’s Blockchain Center for Excellence, has signed an agreement
with Web3 Foundation to explore the implementation of Pact on Polkadot.

Driven by a shared interest in facilitating interoperability among blockchains,
engineering teams from both organizations will share learnings about
architecture, including on WASM+GHC, to identify the strongest opportunities for
integration.

As agreed by Kadena and Web3 Foundation, the technical feasibility study for
Pact implementation on Polkadot is to commence immediately. If successful,
Kadena and Web3 Foundation will consider further steps towards deployment.

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network) empowers blockchain networks to work
together under the protection of shared security. By parallelizing transactions,
Polkadot solves major scalability issues that have thus far hampered blockchain
development. Web3 Foundation is overseeing the launch of Polkadot as its
flagship project.

Pact is the first human-readable smart contract language with Formal
Verification. The simple and secure language can be used by both developers and
business professionals. Pact is open-source and Turing-incomplete to better
support on-chain services.

The feasibility study increases the number of blockchain ecosystems considering
Pact as a smart contract standard. Pact on Polkadot would improve
interoperability, which is key to wider blockchain adoption. With this
agreement, the smart contract language from Kadena is one step closer to
becoming available for the majority of blockchain developers, regardless of
their preferred blockchain.

“Kadena is solving longstanding issues in blockchain that address
interoperability, scalability, and security,” said Will Martino, Founder and CEO
of Kadena. “A big piece of the solution to those issues is Pact, which is
rapidly becoming the standard for smart contracts. In Web3 Foundation, we see an
organization that is equally committed to making blockchain accessible. Polkadot
provides people with a trustless environment where Pact can get broad use.”

“The importance of smart-contract languages is difficult to overstate,” said
Dieter Fishbein, Web3 Foundation’s head of grants. “Web3 Foundation looks
forward to the results of Kadena’s forthcoming feasibility study and to learning
more about the role the Pact language could play in the Polkadot ecosystem.”

The news with Polkadot follows Kadena’s announcement of a collaboration with
interoperable blockchain network [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network). Kadena is
also providing an enterprise-grade solution as a Blockchain-as-a-Service
offering on the
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07MKMKP4F) and
[Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/kadenallc.scalablebft).
