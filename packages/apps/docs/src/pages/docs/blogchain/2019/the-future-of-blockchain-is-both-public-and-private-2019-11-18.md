# The Future of Blockchain Is Both Public and Private

It’s 2019, and with Facebook’s announcement of Libra and J.P. Morgan’s
introduction of JPM Coin, it has become clear that the future of business
involves blockchain technology. What this means in practice, however, is harder
to pinpoint. There is currently a philosophical divide when it comes to
blockchain. The enterprise mindset, as represented by JP Morgan, IBM and the
like, sees blockchain as only being useful if the participants are tightly
controlled. This is what we call a “private” or “permissioned” blockchain.

On the other side, the champions of decentralization, as exemplified by the
Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, see public blockchains where anyone can
participate as the only game in town.

The concept of the
“[hybrid blockchain](/docs/blogchain/2019/hybrid-blockchain-101-2019-10-23)” has
only recently taken root, and it presents a solution where the decentralization
advocates can work alongside enterprise technologists to deliver meaningful
impact on multiple levels. By bridging the divide between traditional workflows
and emerging business models, hybrid blockchain allows all participants to work
together to solve problems and enjoy the best of both worlds.

### Uncovering the Freedom of Decentralization

Public blockchains like Bitcoin are completely free and open. Anyone can
participate. To use it, all you need is a wallet and a few fractions of the
associated crypto asset. Anyone can join the Bitcoin economy as a user or as a
miner. There is no administrator with more control than even the newest user.

This egalitarian decentralization is both a gift and a drawback. Because public
blockchains are so open, their transaction speeds are far slower than businesses
require. This slowness arises from the methods these systems use to ensure
security, like Bitcoin’s battle-tested Proof of Work protocol. Recent
innovations like Proof of Stake attempt to address the speed-security tradeoff
but are too new to prove that they are as secure as Proof of Work.

The best example of a public blockchain, Bitcoin, has entered its second decade
and is on the cusp of vast improvements. Even at its height, Bitcoin performs
like the decade-old technology it is: slowly. That said, Bitcoin remains vital
to the entire blockchain ecosystem.

### **Conserving Data Integrity Through Private Blockchain**

[Private blockchains](/docs/blogchain/2019/scalablebft-kadenas-private-blockchain-101-2019-03-09)
are similar to public blockchains in that they are distributed and immutable.
However, these permissioned blockchains offer businesses many benefits: faster
speeds, greater privacy, and increased peace of mind.

A private blockchain is similar to a series of replicated databases. However,
this class of blockchain can have owners who can selectively share information
with trusted participants while simultaneously allowing for rapid iteration of
blockchain-based products. This allows key enterprise stakeholders to
collaborate in ways never before possible.

_Private Blockchain Use Case:_

- A great example of a private blockchain use case can be found in healthcare,
  which struggles to solve what should be a simple problem: accurate provider
  data. Simply finding out if a doctor is in your network and taking new
  patients is an error-prone cost center the industry spends millions on. With a
  private blockchain, these companies could collaborate to share information
  like doctors’ office addresses, accepted insurances, and office hours, all
  while maintaining their own secure ledgers. Blockchain has the potential to
  save millions of dollars, savings which could get passed on to consumers, by
  making possibilities like this a reality.

**Hybrid is the Way Forward**

As Head of Product at Kadena, I see a true interconnection of public and private
blockchains within the next year. A real hybrid blockchain connects public and
private blockchains seamlessly without singling out any specific set of users or
leaking confidential information.

You can’t disrupt the future without understanding the past, which is where my
20+ years of experience in the banking and financial services industry comes
into play. The many opportunities I see to reduce operational costs through a
streamlined blockchain platform are grounded in first-hand experience. For
example, some of the blockchain use cases already being explored include
Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Client (KYC), and cross-border payments,
where a lot of time and effort is spent on verifying information. Performing
these functions on a hybrid blockchain will provide privacy and a level of
transparency that could be very useful to parties involved on both the private
and public side of transactions.

An era of previously impossible products is fast approaching. In this product
era, hybrid blockchain’s unique ability to combine the capabilities of a
traditional bank’s back office with automated contract enforcement manifests in
the creation of a “sharing economy” among businesses.

_Hybrid Blockchain Use Case:_

- An example of a hybrid blockchain use case can be found in fintech,
  specifically in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that have seen phenomenal growth
  over the last ten years. The growth has led to crowding and competition with
  thin margins for fund managers. To differentiate, a firm can put a regulated
  fund onto the blockchain. This provides investors the ability to tap a larger
  pool of investor liquidity and supports cryptocurrency owners seeking to move
  their assets into traditional securities without a tax event. A hybrid
  blockchain platform enables the firm to create, trade, and monitor securities
  in a manner uniformly compliant with current business operations. Kadena’s
  Pact language assists with effectively maintaining authorization, data
  management, and workflow across both the public and private blockchain.
  Additionally, the use of Proof of Work consensus on Kadena’s public blockchain
  supplements security needs.

Hybrid blockchain works because it eliminates the unnecessary public-private
ideological divide on blockchain. Businesses can reap the benefits of private
blockchain without the tradeoffs, and individual users can participate & control
their personal data in more secure and faster transactions. The ability for both
groups to securely participate on a blockchain helps to realize a modern shared
economy, one where a hybrid blockchain can drive security and efficiency across
all industries.
