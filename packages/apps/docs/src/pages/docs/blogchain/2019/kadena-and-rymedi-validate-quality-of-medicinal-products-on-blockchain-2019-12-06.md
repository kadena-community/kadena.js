# Kadena and Rymedi Validate Quality of Medicinal Products on Blockchain

[Kadena](http://www.kadena.io/), the first blockchain technology company to come
out of JP Morgan’s Blockchain Center for Excellence, announced a strategic
partnership with [Rymedi](https://www.rymedi.com/), providers of a data platform
revolutionizing healthcare supply chains. Rymedi’s integration with Kadena’s
blockchain provides immutable supply genealogy and multi-partner data access,
extending existing client capabilities, ranging from tracking pharmaceutical
supply chain in developing countries such as Mongolia and Kenya to assisting
hemp/CBD growers and extractors looking to bring the safest products to market.

By integrating Kadena’s blockchain into its existing platform, Rymedi further
empowers consumers as well as supply chain members with vital data that’s
previously been unavailable. By scanning a simple barcode with their cell
phones, customers can get data about a product’s origin and journey. This
validates purchasing and authenticity, especially useful in geographies and
industries where fraud and quality concerns remain potentially life-threatening
issues.

“The partnership with Rymedi shows how blockchain technology can positively
contribute to crucial aspects of the healthcare supply chain,” said Will
Martino, Founder and CEO of Kadena. “Many times, illegitimate products can mean
life-or-death for vulnerable communities. We look forward to being part of a
solution that helps prevent the tampering of medicinal products.”

David Stefanich, CEO of Rymedi shares, “With their deep experience in financial
markets and transaction data, Kadena is a uniquely aligned partner for us. With
several use cases already live around the world, we’re making plans to broaden
our partnership and offer even more value to our customers across healthcare
data-silos.”

Blockchain’s capacity to guarantee quality in medicinal products allows everyone
from suppliers to customers to have greater confidence. Kadena and Rymedi look
forward to further collaborating on a data platform that ensures verifiable
medicinal products while also discovering new solutions that can benefit
communities across the globe.
