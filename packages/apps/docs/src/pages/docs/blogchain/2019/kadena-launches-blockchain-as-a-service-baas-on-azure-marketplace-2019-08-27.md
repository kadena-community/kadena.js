# Kadena Launches Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) on Azure Marketplace

_Learn more about our easy provisioning and formally verified smart contracts on
Microsoft’s cloud platform._

**August 27, 2019 — New York, NY** — We are excited to announce that we’ve
[launched an upgraded version](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/kadena-brings-free-private-blockchain-service-to-azure-marketplace/)
of our enterprise blockchain solution to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace! The
“**[Kadena Scalable Permissioned Blockchain](http://bit.ly/KadenaAzure)**” is
now available on Azure Marketplace for free. This past January, we made
headlines in [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/01/23/blockchain-aws-kadena/)
when we released our permissioned blockchain on the
**[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace](http://kadena.io/aws)**.

Our Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) model enables organizations to start using
Kadena’s blockchain by quickly provisioning it online, significantly reducing
the cost and time-to-market associated with the on-premise installation of other
blockchain solutions today.

As the first blockchain offering on Microsoft Azure Marketplace to offer
[Formal Verification](/docs/blogchain/2018/pact-formal-verification-for-blockchain-smart-contracts-done-right-2018-05-11),
Kadena’s scalable solution enables enterprises to efficiently transact and share
data in a secure and decentralized manner. Our existing blockchain clients
include $3 billion asset manager
[USCF Investments](https://coindesk.com/enterprise-blockchain-kadena-announces-mainnet-launch-this-october),
healthcare technology company [Rymedi](https://www.rymeditech.com/), and leading
Latin American technology business [Alteum](https://alteum.io), as well as one
of the world’s top 100 largest banks (we will be able to disclose the name in
the coming months), and Fortune 500 companies.

“In building with Microsoft, Kadena is committed to providing an accessible
onramp to blockchain for businesses of all sizes,” said Will Martino, Founder
and CEO of Kadena. “We are excited to bring our secure and scalable technology
to Azure customers as we continue working with Microsoft Azure Marketplace to
develop cloud-enabled blockchain solutions.”

Kadena’s blockchain platform includes its innovative and open source smart
contract language, [Pact](http://pact.kadena.io), designed for both developers
and non-technical people alike and has safeguards to avoid bugs, a critical
feature given over $1bn has been lost to date owing to bugs in smart contracts.

“Pact’s formal verification of user code allows you to harness the same
mathematical methods used by aerospace and nuclear power engineers to catch
potential exploits before deployment,” said Kadena Founder and President Stuart
Popejoy. “With Kadena’s blockchain, you don’t need a degree in formal
mathematics to have mission-critical security protecting your business
applications.”

In the new Azure edition, we’ve made significant upgrades to our market-defining
features, allowing for greater security and interoperability. These features are
also now available with the [AWS version](http://kadena.io/aws) of Kadena’s
permissioned blockchain.

The headlining features of our new edition include:

- **Native support for cross-blockchain transactions** — laying the groundwork
  for Kadena’s public and permissioned blockchains to interoperate with each
  other, as well as blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

- **Formally verified interfaces** — creating a mathematical secure proof for a
  feature that is similar to constructs in other programming languages such as
  Java, Rust, and Scala. This reduces the occurrence of attacks, critical bugs,
  exploits, and hacks.

- **Expanded Formal Verification coverage across the Pact language** — granting
  businesses greater assurance that every aspect of their smart contract code is
  bug-free.

Kadena’s Scalable Permission Blockchain Community Edition on Azure is free to
use and supports up to four nodes and 2,000 transactions per second. This
version will also support secure channels, trustless escrows, pluggable
encryption, contract governance, and automatic bug detection via Formal
Verification. The feature set is unmatched by other private blockchain products
in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Clients seeking to leverage the full power
of the technology, with transaction speeds up to 8,000 tps and 500+ nodes, will
want to license the full version of Kadena’s enterprise blockchain software by
contacting [support@kadena.io](mailto:support@kadena.io).
