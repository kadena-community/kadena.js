# Kadena Private Blockchain Launches on Amazon (AWS) Marketplace

### Scalable enterprise smart-contract solution now available to AWS users for free

While [Kadena](http://kadena.io) is currently making waves in public blockchain
and safer smart contracts,
[raising $12M last year](https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-startup-kadena-raises-12-million-saft-sale)
and bringing one of the forefathers of cryptography to our
[advising team](https://unhashed.com/cryptocurrency-news/kadena-brings-blockchain-forefather-stuart-haber-board/)
— our first and founding invention was a truly scalable, truly distributed
ledger known as ScalableBFT, dubbed by CoinDesk as
“[The First Real Private Blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/evolution-kadena-first-real-private-blockchain).”

Today, we’re pleased to announce that our secure and scalable private blockchain
platform is **now live
[on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace](http://kadena.io/aws)**! Our
“Community Edition” is free, so you can now rapidly evaluate, build, and deploy
blockchain-enabled solutions on our next generation blockchain, at no cost and
within a few clicks.

### What is Kadena’s Private Blockchain?

Kadena’s ScalableBFT enables enterprises across a range of industries to
efficiently transact and share data in a decentralized manner. Our team brings
experience from building JP Morgan’s blockchain technology.

Unlike other enterprise blockchains, Kadena’s technology has been
[tested to support up to 8,000 transactions per second across 500 nodes](https://kadena.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kadena-ConsensusWhitePaper-Aug2016.pdf),
with the ability to support thousands of users. Our platform
uses[ Pact](http://github.com/kadena-io/pact), Kadena’s open source and simple
smart contract language that is understandable to auditors, developers, and
executives.

The “ScalableBFT: Community Edition” offering on AWS is intended for evaluation
and small-deployment purposes, with 2,000 transactions per second across 4
nodes. If you’re interested in acquiring an expanded AWS-hosted Enterprise
Edition of our blockchain, [let us know](mailto:support@kadena.io)!

### What can I use Kadena’s private blockchain for?

A private (also known as a permissioned) blockchain is used for cases where you
want the benefits of having a decentralized database, but need the security of
knowing exactly who the participants are in your network. Private blockchains
chains
[do not use “mining”](/docs/blogchain/2019/why-mining-private-blockchains-dont-mix-2019-02-06),
unlike public blockchains.

Kadena’s private blockchain has been used in production by companies in
healthcare to manage patient and provider data, but there are many opportunities
in insurance, oil & gas, and financial services. What can our blockchain do that
other blockchains cannot? Consider:

- Deploying more than 5+ nodes without performance degradation.

- Upgrading your contracts to fix bugs or change permissions.

- Ensuring the privacy of your transactions to non-participants: Kadena uses the
  symmetric encryption technology behind Signal and Whatsapp plus fully blinded
  addressing to provide secure channel confidentiality without sacrificing the
  benefits of a blockchain.

- The opportunity to
  [hybridize your private blockchain with a scalable, public chain](/docs/blogchain/2018/blockchain-future-smart-contract-sharing-economy-2018-12-17)
  to unlock trapped liquidity.

Wondering what blockchain can do for your industry? Ben Jessel explains how
[enterprises can overcome the hurdles of adopting blockchain](https://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/it-strategy/what-enterprises-need-to-make-the-leap-to-blockchain/a/d-id/1333598).
