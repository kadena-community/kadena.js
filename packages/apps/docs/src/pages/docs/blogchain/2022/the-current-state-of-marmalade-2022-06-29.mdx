## The Current State of Marmalade

[Marmalade](https://marmalade.art/) is the new Kadena standard for NFTs,
addressing long-standing concerns plaguing NFT markets today, like the inability
to enforce requirements (i.e., royalties) on the sale of an NFT. We’d like to
update our incredible community of builders on Marmalade and our roadmap for the
future.

In March, we released Marmalade as a beta version as a soft launch, to allow
builders currently working on Marmalade to push their front-end to mainnet. The
current infrastructure is launched in a limited capacity, with smart contracts
deployed on chain 8 in mainnet and chain 1 in testnet. Our aim is to solicit
feedback from the community and encourage builders to continue iterating on our
infrastructure. We welcome any and all feedback and are very happy with the
feedback we have gotten so far! Once the community has had a chance to work with
the beta and we continue to build more improvements, we will expand to
[Multichain](./the-future-of-multichain-2022-04-19).

In February, we also released a POC UI on testnet, which was intended primarily
as technical inspiration for what’s possible on the front-end for Marmalade.
However, Kadena is not planning to build an NFT marketplace on Marmalade —
that’s what our powerful community is for! Our core focus is to provide the
community with the best toolset possible to enable and empower others to build
upon our current infrastructure. We will continue iterating on the standards,
protocols, tooling, and tech documentation to support builders in their own
development efforts these upcoming months.

There were also some questions from the community about the status of DIDs. This
is on hold for the current beta, as identifiers are now being unified with Pact
Principals. Manifests currently offer the ability to include rich content with
iterative hashing for integrity, including DID URIs.

We really appreciate all of the excitement around Marmalade! In the upcoming
months, we intend to communicate a full product roadmap that will share our
focus area for the remainder of the year. If you’re interested in building on
Marmalade, we are available on Discord and Telegram to answer your Marmalade
questions and provide infrastructure support.
