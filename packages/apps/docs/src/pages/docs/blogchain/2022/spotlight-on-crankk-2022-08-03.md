# Spotlight On: Crankk

Welcome to Kadena Eco’s Project Spotlight Series, where we highlight the
groundbreaking work of organizations currently building on Kadena!

Today, we’re shining the spotlight on Crankk, A community-founded project that
has developed distributed wireless networks that provide coverage for IoT
devices such as smart meters and GPS trackers. Using Kadena’s low gas fees and
its secure and high throughput Proof-of-Work network, Crankk plans to build a
community network for LoRaWan coverage with better transparency and with checks
running through Pact.

We recently spoke with Peter Varga, Crankk.io’s founder, about his recently
created Proof-of-Coverage network that he plans to build along with his open
source hardware and software.

### 1. How do you explain Crankk in simple terms? Give us your elevator pitch.

Crankk is a resource-sharing IoT network. Miners operate IoT gateways earning
Crankk tokens for providing LoRaWAN coverage. The network will have external
customers paying a fee for that coverage. Network earnings get distributed among
gateway operators.

### 2. Share with us your background on how you got started in this space.

I come from a large scale enterprise business applications background as well as
a business and consumer-facing IoT background. First built a Paypal merchant
services type of application on Ethereum but high gas fees and other
distractions turned me away quickly. My first Kadena experience was buying a
home miner and operating it roughly 2 years ago. Then checked out Kadena’s
background and smart contract language and made the decision to continue
developing on Kadena.

### 3. How does Crankk plan to innovate on the Proof-of-Coverage network ideas compared to other companies like Helium Network?

In my mind, it’s a long game. The decision to build on Kadena was probably one
of the crucial ones. This sets us up with a strong technical basis and a strong
community to build on. It also implies a lot more open architecture. Everything
needs to be independently verifiable to earn and maintain the trust of the
community as well as customers. We have a lot of ideas on how to build a
distributed resource-sharing network. Working on the sales side and making sure
that the network starts earning revenue from the very beginning is important. So
is staying open and welcoming new technologies onto the network when it makes
sense.

### 4. What attracted you to Kadena and to apply for a Grant with Kadena Eco?

For me, it was the fact that Kadena has a proper database behind it. It provided
enough motivation to learn Pact as well. Seeing the community develop and mature
around it with multiple diverse projects getting started is also a great benefit
in a very practical sense. Applying for a Kadena Grant meant to hope to obtain
the support of Kadena itself and earn the right to be a respectable member
project of the ecosystem.

### 5. What can we expect from Crankk in the next 6 months? Where will you be in 3 years?

In the next 6 months, we’d like to gradually expand our device offerings and
work with manufacturers to offload some of the work and concentrate on our core
competency.

In 3 years, we’d like us to have grown into an IoT network with global coverage
and an increasing set of exciting features

### 6. What advice would you give to entrepreneurs looking to innovate in blockchain?

Follow your heart and build something you’re passionate about. Ask yourself
about the value blockchain technology brings to the table. Try to make it as
distributed and non-custodial as possible to maximize the value brought on by
the blockchain.
