## Kadena Eco Onboards Strategic Advisory Board to Fuel Growth

From Day 1, Kadena and Kadena Eco have been the leading forces in Blockchain
focused on builders. Today, we announce the formation of a Strategic Advisory
Board, uniting technical founders and entrepreneurs with the world’s top
blockchain leaders, venture capitalists, and acceleration partners to support
startups at every phase of their development journey.

Today, we welcome Brooke Skinner Ricketts, President of Beyond Barriers to the
Kadena Eco family as Strategic Advisor. As an esteemed leader and
marketing/product/growth pioneer, Brooke will partner with me to define the next
in-class marketing for web3. Brooke brings decades of experience in technology,
marketing, and strategy to our table, and the perspective of a web2 executive
who is leading a web3 endeavor. She’s known for her collaborative and creative
approach and has a track record of connecting with developers, engineers, and
builders.

The markets have proven again that we are running a marathon, not a sprint.
Kadena Eco is here to stay and we are revolutionizing the builder experience. We
remain relentless in our pursuit of increasing the speed of Web3 development and
adoption of meaningful applications that benefit everyday people, worldwide.
