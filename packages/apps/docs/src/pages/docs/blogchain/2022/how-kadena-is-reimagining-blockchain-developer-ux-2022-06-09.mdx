## How Kadena is Reimagining Blockchain Developer UX

The primary focus of Kadena these last few years has been to create a
state-of-the-art first layer blockchain development solution. In that quest,
we’re not ashamed to admit that we’ve also gone big and bold by setting out to
completely revolutionize the blockchain world.

As we’ve focused on building our core set of tools and development platform, our
rockstar team of developers and early adopters have continued to provide us with
outstanding feedback. And we’ve been listening very carefully. While this
process hasn’t always been easy, the tradeoffs have been worthwhile as we’ve
been able to slow down, assess, and validate the true value of our technology
with our growing community.

One thing we’ve become convinced of along the way is that no matter how good our
technology might be, nothing can replace the value of the user experience. That
much is essential! And so, based on our research and feedback from builders,
we’re very happy to report that Kadena is working on creating an entirely new
developer experience that will be truly game-changing.

Let’s jump into some more details about what’s been happening behind the scenes
and some of the cool new features and UI that you can soon expect.

### We’ve been listening carefully

Obviously, Rome wasn’t built in a day. While Kadena has made great strides in
transforming the DeFi and blockchain marketplace through its
[extended ecosystem](https://kadena.io/ecosystem/), we still face challenges —
especially in our front-end experience. Many of our users have already helpfully
shared feedback with us in forums like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kadena_io)
and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bsUcWmX). What we’ve heard is that:

- Building a basic application on our platform can be tough; the learning curve
  is high.

- Kadena’s documentation is disparate and not as organized as builders would
  like.

- Our JavaScript APIs and SDKs are written in a more traditional manner that’s
  out of scope with how Web3 developers want to work today.

At Kadena, all user feedback gets taken very seriously and we’ve heard you loud
and clear. We are completely transparent about our challenges and unwilling to
ignore what history has shown us — that even the best technologies will fail if
the UX isn’t ideal.

### Here’s what our team has been up to

We believe Kadena is set to become the dominant platform for blockchain
development. Here are some major reasons why:

- First, we have developed a revolutionary braided architecture of 20 chains,
  which makes it the most advanced and fastest blockchain platform in the world.
  Kadena is currently the only proof of work platform capable of scaling to
  settle the 9+ million trades executed daily on the New York Stock Exchange.
  Kadena is also built on
  [Pact](https://docs.kadena.io/learn-pact/beginner/welcome-to-pact) — the first
  truly human readable smart contract language.

- Second, we’ve brought together a passionate community of 100s of builders,
  miners, and advocates who are spreading the word about Kadena and creating
  everything from smart contracts to crypto wallets to hosts of other
  decentralized blockchain applications (dapps).

- Third, we have some [insanely smart people](https://kadena.io/about/#team)
  working to transform Kadena into the most secure, scalable, and resilient
  blockchain development platform in the world.

### An entirely new user experience is just around the corner

Kadena aims to continue building and supporting our developer community with a
robust, best-in-class experience for Web3 developers. We’ve already completed
[significant milestones to our platform and ecosystem](https://kadena.io/roadmap/),
but even bigger plans lie in store for the near future. Some of the major
benchmarks on our roadmap include:

- New documentation site release, frequently updated

- Revamped tutorial section and more engaging images and videos

- Kadena developer academy with certifications & badges

- User-friendly tooling and resources for Web3 development, including more
  robust API’s and SDK’s

After hitting these goals, the Kadena team will celebrate by hosting a super
cool hackathon to promote new blockchain features and functionalities on our
fresh new UI.

### We’ve come a long way — but still just getting started

Remember the Internet browser wars? The battle was primarily between Internet
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox in the early days of the Internet. Google’s
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) was a relatively late entry
into the market that went public in October 2008 but soon became the dominant
market player by focusing on the technology and developer tools. Today, Chrome
dominates the market with an estimated
[3.2 billion global users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/543218/worldwide-internet-users-by-browser/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20there%20were%20an,users%20for%20Chrome%20and%20Safari.).
Meanwhile,
[IE 11 will no longer be supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support)
as of June 2022, and
[Firefox struggles with a substantial flattening of active users](https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-mozilla-2022/#:~:text=Mozilla's%20own%20statistics%20show%20a,substantial%20flattening%2C%E2%80%9D%20Deckelmann%20adds.).

Kadena was founded in 2016 by
[former leaders of J.P. Morgan’s first cryptocurrency team](https://kadena.io/about/),
built on a vision of transforming how the world interacts and transacts with
blockchain. Similar to Chrome, our founders focused on the technology first. Now
with that firmly in place, we’re turning our focus to reimagining the builder
experience into something truly game-changing. We’re just getting started and
would love for you to be part of that conversation!

### Come and build with us!

At Kadena, we’re very excited about the revolutionary possibilities ahead in the
world of blockchain development. With our superior technology, robust community,
and strong commitment to scalability and resilience in the marketplace, we
believe it’s possible to bring Kadena into the mainstream and help democratize
the future of Web3.

Won’t you join us on this quest to change how the world interacts and transacts?
With your help, we can create a more equitable, sustainable, and secure future
for the entire global economic community.
