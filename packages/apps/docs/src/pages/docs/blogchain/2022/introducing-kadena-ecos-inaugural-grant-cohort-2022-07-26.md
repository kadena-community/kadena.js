# Introducing Kadena Eco’s Inaugural Grant Cohort

By Dan Wiggins, Head of Gaming, Kadena Eco

In April, Kadena Eco
[announced its grants program](./kadena-eco-grants-2022-04-21), spurring
countless conversations with founders with big ideas for building on Kadena. Our
team was blown away and at times overwhelmed by the volume and quality of
applications over the past few months. We’re now ready to share our first cohort
of grant recipients — and more on why we selected the grantees that we did.

But first, a quick reminder of the objectives we had in mind when we kicked off
the grant program;

- Support early-stage, Kadena-based projects by providing product and technical
  feedback as well as providing monetary and marketing support

- Align incentives with new builders, foster collaboration and knowledge sharing
  between teams, and help projects grow within the broader ecosystem

Given the interest in grants programs for new projects and those possibly
[migrating from other blockchain partners](./kadena-commitment-to-builders-2022-05-27),
we’ve discovered that there’s no shortage of interest in Kadena. At Kadena and
Kadena Eco, we’re focused on building and supporting blockchain innovations that
offer long-term applicability and durability. We sought founders who are
similarly committed to iterating their dApps, tools, and infrastructure projects
over long-term time horizons.

Ultimately, we signed agreements with nine projects. These projects caught our
attention because they’re united in their long-term approach to building,
integrity, and technical expertise. We also considered many factors before
deciding on each grant, such as a team’s overall commitment — was it just an
idea, or were they already writing PACT and participating in Discord? We also
looked at how much sweat equity and other resources each team has invested into
its project.

We wanted to know: who’s in this for real?

As grant proposals streamed in from the community, our team at Kadena Eco jumped
headfirst into analyzing their plans, deliberating projects, and getting to know
founders. We’re thrilled to share with you our inaugural class of grant
recipients consisting of projects focused on infrastructure, NFTs, and developer
tools and education.

It’s time. Without further ado, please meet our newest collaborators!

## Infrastructure

- **Lago Finance **— \*\*\*\*provider of foundational DeFi infrastructure,
  including a bridge to Ethereum to facilitate liquidity inflow to Kadena as
  well as a Kadena-native stablecoin.

- **Kalend Finance** — Decentralized lending/borrowing protocol with
  algorithmically-set interest rates based on supply and demand. Users exchange
  the time value of assets on Kadena frictionlessly with instant liquidation and
  insurance pools.

- **Electron Labs** — Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology company focused on bringing
  horizontal scaling and on-chain privacy, two key blockchain infrastructure
  components.

- **Unmarshal **— Multi-chain data infrastructure offering simplified access to
  DeFi, NFT, and Metaverse data, with built-in composability and sustainability.
  Unmarshal’s data indexing protocol facilitates seamless access to on-chain
  data for DeFi applications.

- **Crankk **— \*\*\*\*Builder of distributed wireless networks that provides
  coverage for IoT devices such as smart meters and GPS trackers.

## Developer Tools & Education

- **Hypercent **— a fair launch IDO platform, NFT Launchpad and NFT Marketplace

- **KDlaunch & KDSwap** — a decentralized IDO (initial DEX offering) platform,
  launchpad, DEX, and NFT Marketplace.

- **Eucalyptus Labs** — a \*\*\*\*Kadena software developer focused on shipping
  products and adding support in two key areas, developer UX and infrastructure

## Utility NFTs

- **The Database of Native Assets (DNA)** — a token-based bridge between the
  physical and digital worlds. Creators mint branded DNA tokens that prove a
  product’s provenance and authenticity, reducing counterfeiting risk.

The Kadena Eco team could not be more delighted to work with such diverse
talent. Congratulations to all and thank you to all the applicants!
