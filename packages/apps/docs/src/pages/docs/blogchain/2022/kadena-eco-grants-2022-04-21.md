# Kadena Eco Grants: What You Need To Know

_Create something new — for yourself and the world_

Blockchain is one of the most significant technologies of our time. In fact,
it’s essential as we move into a world that is increasingly digital.

That’s why today, we’ve launched a $100 million Grant Program to inspire
builders to come and innovate on the Kadena network.

Kadena Eco exists to empower builders to create new projects that transform the
world. To realize this mission, we’re doubling down on our growing community by
deploying capital towards the long-term sustainability of our ecosystem.

Kadena Eco grants will be applied to projects big and small, enabling builders
of all backgrounds to succeed on Kadena. With our network of technology experts
and strategic partners, we’re here to support builders every step of the way.

### How it works

The application process is
[open](https://khnrs3ltkjv.typeform.com/grant-app?typeform-source=www.google.com)!
All high-quality, open-source projects for gaming, metaverse, NFT, Web3, DeFi
and DAOs are welcome.

We will judge grant applications based on the following:

1.  Technical strength

2.  Detail of specifications

3.  Team experience

4.  Usefulness to the Kadena ecosystem

Applicants must be willing to adopt Kadena’s “build in the open” philosophy by
contributing content, tutorials and product explainers in relevant channels and
communities such as Discord, Medium, Stackoverflow and others. In turn, Kadena
Eco will commit to engineering mentorship, office hours and community leadership
in addition to monetary support.

Beyond grant money, you’ll also get support from myself and the rest of the
Kadena team to get you off the ground and building for success.

### The first of many exciting announcements

Certainly our grant program is a gateway to get started with Kadena, but there’s
more to know.

Alongside grants, Kadena Eco offers other valuable resources to turbocharge
development on Kadena:

- An accelerator (for early capital and mentorship)

- An incubator (for hands-on project development)

- A venture fund (for later-stage capital and strategy)

- Research and development (to turn technical theories into real-world
  applications)

Consider grants just one of many forthcoming announcements — all designed to
bolster the growth of Kadena’s ecosystem. By bringing together top industry
minds, talent, and investors, Kadena Eco is supporting tomorrow’s best and
brightest developments in gaming, metaverse, NFT, web3, DeFi, and DAO — all on
Kadena’s blockchain.

### Kadena brings remarkable advancement to blockchain

In 2017, Will Martino and Stuart Popejoy founded Kadena to reimagine blockchain
from the ground up. As former JPMorgan tech leaders tasked with analyzing
current day blockchain platforms, they spotted bottlenecks that would emerge
just a few years down the line. Their subsequent work at Kadena has solved a
trio of key problems that continue to persist in blockchain today — the
“trilemma” of scalability, security and decentralization.

Kadena is a proprietary, multi-chain architecture with tools made for everyone.
Never before has a blockchain technology offered such speed, scale, and energy
efficiency — Kadena combines the functionality of blockchain tech with the
accessibility of today’s internet, making it the perfect platform for builders
to create their projects.

Those already building on Kadena know that our Proof of Work blockchain has the
potential to truly scale this technology. They’ve spread the word, given us
valuable feedback, and now we are a strategic inflection point for growth. With
100 community projects and more than 200 engineers building on the platform, the
age of Kadena is here.

**Making blockchain accessible to everyone**

I joined Kadena to be part of the effort to reimagine blockchain. Like many of
the people in our ecosystem, I am an entrepreneur, builder and technologist. I
know what it takes to build a company, I know the technology you need to make
that happen, and I know the passion of building and creating new applications.

With similar experiences and the potential to collaborate on big things, I
invite you to join our community by applying for a grant today. The future is
wide open; starting with grants could open doors down the road to our incubator
program and beyond.

No matter how you get started with Kadena Eco, consider this: not only do we
have the resources and infrastructure to create a multi-generational,
sustainable ecosystem, but we’re also committed to responsible innovation —
building in an open and transparent way.

Kadena Eco is taking blockchain mainstream. Our $100 million grant program is
just the start. There’s no better time than now!
