# 4 Ways Kadena Is Taking Blockchain Mainstream

_Kadena founder Stuart Popejoy recently joined Okcoin for a Twitter Spaces chat
in which he discussed numerous topics, including Kadena’s big plans to appeal to
the masses._

### 1: Kadena Eco

Early this year, Kadena launched [Kadena Eco,](https://kadena.io/eco/) an
initiative designed to supercharge blockchain’s biggest thinkers, top-tier tech
talent, and unparalleled strategic capital to fuel the hypergrowth of Kadena’s
ecosystem with the technological and strategic help they need. “Simplifying
crypto is what we are targeting at Kadena, and Kadena Eco will help us realize
this important goal,” said Popejoy, who joined Okcoin on Twitter Spaces recently
to celebrate the listing of Kadena’s native coin, KDA.

> “Kadena Eco will be core to the Kadena ecosystem,” said Popejoy. “Its primary
> purpose will be to allocate funds to builders from DeFi to NFTs to gaming and
> beyond. Some projects Kadena Eco has already funded include
> [Marmalade](http://marmalade.art), which can guarantee the uniqueness of NFTs
> by allowing developers and users to store more data on the chain than
> Ethereum, which forces developers to store information off chain.”

### 2: Pact

Kadena has created a native smart contract programming language more intuitive
and more powerful than Ethereum’s Solidity. “While creating our smart contract
language, Pact, we studied not only Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine,
but also Bitcoin’s script,” noted Popejoy. “Something that Bitcoin script
reached for and didn’t quite achieve is a language that is as powerful but is
fundamentally safe and protects you, as a dapp developer, from bugs that really
should never be allowed in the first place. While Satoshi fell short, we believe
we have achieved that goal.”

On SavedByKadena.com, developers can explore historical crypto hacks and see
how, if the dapp had been coded in Pact, the bug would not have been possible to
even write into code. “Pact is fundamentally safe and protects you as a dapp
developer from certain bugs found in other blockchains,” said Stuart.

### 3: Kadena Is A Layer 1 With The Power Of Layer 2

During the Twitter Spaces, Popejoy noted how Layer 2 technologies introduce
complexity. “Lightning Network on Bitcoin is a good example of some of the
complexity that results when you start putting another system on top of a Layer
1 blockchain; it just changes the trust model and the threat model,” he said.
“…One of the things we’re shooting for is to make Kadena’s Layer 1 as usable as
possible for the average dapp developer and crypto user. One important way to
help users is to ensure low fees.”

Layer 2 solutions don’t guarantee low fees. “Stacks doesn’t help you with
Bitcoin fees,” said Popejoy. “There’s no solution to high Ethereum fees
presently. Our system has low fees, because it’s scalable. Gas can return to its
true function in a system like Ethereum, which is to make people play fairly
with each other in terms of how much they use the resources of the system, and
not to enrich miners or validators at the users expense.”

### 4: Proof Of Work Is Scalable, Proof Of Stake Is Not

Popejoy told the Okcoin team that there is a major misconception in the
blockchain industry. Many believe Proof of Stake is scalable while Proof of Work
is not. Proof of Work’s functionality can be distributed over numerous chains
without sacrificing security. Proof of Stake, on the other hand, always requires
a validator set which, if split up between multiple chains, loses security.

Every Proof of Stake system that is trying to scale has some hard limit they’re
going to hit eventually. When you take Kadena’s design approach to distribute
over numerous chains, Proof of Work proves more scalable than Proof of Stake.
The fact is, Proof Of Work-based Layer 1 technology can handle industrial use
cases along the lines of clearing the entire US stock market on Kadena. “We
could do it today,” said Stuart. “That’s the scale we’re talking about.”
