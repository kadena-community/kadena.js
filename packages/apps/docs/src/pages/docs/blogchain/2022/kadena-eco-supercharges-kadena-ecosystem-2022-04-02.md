# Kadena Eco Supercharges Kadena Ecosystem

By Doug Beardsley, Technical Advisor to Kadena Eco and Director of Engineering,
Kadena

When we look back on the evolution of the blockchain industry 10 years from now,
I believe that 2021 will stand out as a major inflection point. It was the first
year that the blockchain world noticed that Kadena had solved the biggest
problem in the industry: scaling the proof of work consensus method to meet
global transaction loads without sacrificing decentralization and openness.

Developers and end users alike started to see that Kadena provided a genuinely
better system, which fully realized the potential of blockchain technology, and
freed the industry from the problems by which it had been plagued for years. As
a result, we’ve experienced an exponential rise in the number of projects being
built on Kadena.

Here’s an example of what this means for you.

Exorbitant transaction fees will be a thing of the past. With Kadena, DeFi users
won’t be crushed by having to spend hundreds of dollars to do simple things like
exchange tokens, use multisig wallets and mint NFTs.

During the summer of 2021, transaction fees on the ETH network increased by as
much as 470% compared with earlier in the year. According to
[Arcane Research](https://www.research.arcane.no/), the mean transaction fee was
more than $50 on certain days last year. Token swaps cost users more than $200.

These fees have more or less minimized DeFi use to a club of whales for whom a
few hundred dollars isn’t even a blip on their account balance.

High fees are without question a leading limiting factor to the widespread
adoption of blockchain technology. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, has
pointed to the dampening effect of high fees on adoption. “[T]he only solution
to high tx fees is scaling,” tweeted Buterin. “Tether, Gitcoin and other apps
are doing the right thing by migrating to ZK rollups today. I’m excited about
the soon-upcoming optimistic rollups that will generalize rollup scaling to full
EVM contracts.”
[Scaling](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1300990520831877120) is seen
as the accepted solution.

In 2021, Kadena became recognized as having solved the high fee problem, opening
up a huge addressable market.

**Kadena: the foundation for enduring innovations**

A blockchain ecosystem, like Rome, can’t be built in a day. Kadena has put in
place the foundational infrastructure — the roads and aqueducts — but we still
need to build the cities and society. This cannot be done by a single entity.
Despite the legend about the building of Rome, it took more than Romulus and
Remus — twin sons of Mars, the god of war — to build.

Reliable and robust blockchain ecosystems will likewise be built by an entire
community of people that spans regions and even generations. This is where
Kadena Eco comes in.

**Kadena Eco: empowering developers with resources, expertise and funding**

Kadena Eco drives the development of a whole ecosystem that will become the
decentralized financial system of the future; a world where dice and a little
math are the only things needed to open a bank account.

For builders, Kadena Eco provides access to the best set of knowledge, tools,
and development practices to get them up to speed with Kadena’s innovative
concepts and development practices. Companies funded by Kadena Eco will be
positioned to deliver superior value in less time than the competition.

Additionally, this relationship will allow Kadena to stay abreast of what
builders are encountering in the real world and allow us to continue to evolve
the core blockchain infrastructure to meet their needs.

I am excited to be taking on the role of technical advisor to Kadena Eco. In
combination with my role as Kadena’s Director of Engineering, this opens up a
two-way flow of information between those building on Kadena and the engineering
team designing and maintaining the system. Working together, we’ll gain insights
from your vision and help you achieve them. Let’s connect.
