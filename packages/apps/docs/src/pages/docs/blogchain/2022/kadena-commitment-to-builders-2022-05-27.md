## Kadena Commitment To Builders

_10% of $100 million grant program earmarked for affected builders_

Kadena is the blockchain for builders — the people who are building the next
generation of the Internet. Whether you’re new to Web3 or an experienced Web3
developer who’s been impacted by recent events in the crypto industry, we’re
here to help. This is a moment of reckoning. Not just for builders, but for the
crypto community as a whole.

At Kadena, we believe that a thriving ecosystem for builders is rooted in solid
tech. This gives us hope and optimism for the future. We’ve created the only
scalable, layer-1 proof of work platform capable of settling the equivalent of
millions of daily trades executed on the NYSE for everything from DeFi and NFTs
to other crypto innovations.

We’re committed to delivering continued improvements to better our user
experience in building on our platform. While much of the tech and innovation
sector is currently experiencing hiring freezes, we’re looking to double our
team of world-class engineers and operators by the end of 2022.

And we’re excited to form long-term partnerships with the best innovators and
builders in the world. That’s why we’re investing $100 million in a grant
program to support web3 developers, with 10% of that grant money earmarked to
help projects and communities that stalled as a result of recent developments
within the web3 industry.

### Solving the Blockchain Trilemma of Security, Decentralization, and Scalability

Kadena is a proprietary, multi-chain architecture with tools made for everyone.
Never before has blockchain technology offered such speed, scale, and energy
efficiency. Kadena combines the functionality of blockchain tech with the
accessibility of today’s Internet, making it the perfect platform for builders
to create their projects.

That’s because Kadena scales horizontally with a truly sharded system, enabling
us to scale proof of work infinitely. Kadena’s Layer 1 proof of work blockchain,
Chainweb, provides limitless scalability in a consensus mechanism that utilizes
an innovative system of ‘braiding’ between multiple parallel ‘peer’ chains. And
Kadena’s unique infinitely-scalable architecture and revolutionary smart
contract language, Pact, delivers the critical features that allow builders to
deliver Web3 innovation and fundamentals with Web2 usability.

The result is the next-generation blockchain: one that combines the superior
security of proof of work chains like Bitcoin with the benefits of proof of
stake — speed, scalability, and lower gas fees and emissions.

### We’re Committing $10 Million To Blockchain Developers Impacted By Recent Events in the Web3 Space

We know that some developers are hurting right now, and Kadena is not sitting on
the sidelines.

Recently, we introduced Kadena Eco’s $100 million grant program. In order to aid
builders, we’re earmarking 10% of our grant program specifically to help
projects impacted by recent events in the blockchain industry to migrate to
Kadena’s network.

Affected builders won’t just receive money from Kadena. Our Kadena grant program
entails much more. We’ve established five strategic components that Kadena Eco
offers to support founders and entrepreneurs:

1.  An **incubator** for hands-on technical development to advance builder
    skills and ideas

2.  An **accelerator** for early capital and guidance to empower startups from
    launch to scale

3.  **R&D** to architect the Kadena infrastructure required to transform complex
    technical concepts into real-world practical applications

4.  A **grant program** to support community-oriented projects

5.  A **venture fund** offering smart capital and strategic growth and
    operational expertise to propel companies using or pivoting to Kadena’s
    blockchain platform to realize their vision

We’ve already distributed grant funds to an array of innovative companies in the
early and concept stages. Our first round of grant recipients will be announced
in this space in the coming weeks. Continue following us on
[Medium](https://medium.com/kadena-io) to stay apprised of what’s new.

So, builders, we’ve got your back. Do your research, investigate blockchain
partners, and remember that we exist to turbocharge your vision.

For the industry as a whole, it’s time to focus on the fundamentals of building
real products.

Kadena’s world-class ecosystem is grounded in safe, secure, and scalable tech to
support builders and entrepreneurs of all kinds, at any stage in their journey.

No matter how you come to Kadena, our deep investments in blockchain technology
are making crypto safer, more stable, and better for the future.
