## Kadena.js — actNumber has been Released

We are thrilled to announce that PactNumber is now released in Kadena.js.

What is PactNumber and how is it used?

PactNumber is a typescript class that provides useful number functions for
frontend builders to generate Pact Code conveniently with accuracy. In this
article, we’ll take a look at the use of numbers in KDA transfer functions and
introduce the usage of PactNumber.

## Integer vs Decimal vs String

Pact functions often require numbers to be typed as integers or decimals. The
amount in KDA transfer functions are typed as decimal. Therefore, the sample
code below will receive a type error, “_expected decimal, found integer”._

PactNumber now provides the functions `toInteger()` and `toDecimal()`, so
builders can forget about number type errors, just like the code below.

There are also cases when we want to read numbers as strings. One example is the
Chain IDs that are used in KDA’s cross chain transfers. Builders need to be
aware that even though Kadena chains consist of integers ranging from 0..19, the
Kadena chains are specified as strings. The 4th argument in the below example
specifies the target chain as chain 10.

PactNumber now provides the functions to stringify any type of numbers with
`toStringifiedInteger()` and` toStringifiedDecimal()`

### Pact native functions

We have looked composing Pact codes with different number types from Javascript
with PactNumber. There also exists Pact native functions to read numbers from
`data` field: `read-msg` , `read-decimal` , `read-integer`.

![Example 4) KDA transfer function — using read-decimal](/assets/blog/0_Q73fcLyJ23dnn1Vi.png)

Above code is one example of writing the KDA transfer function with
`read-decimal`, where `amount` is passed into data field as a string. This way,
amount is always read as decimals, and the type error shown in example 1 is
prevented.

`read-msg` is also a function to read from data field, regardless of the type.
Below are examples that depict how the numbers are formatted differently to be
read as different types in Pact.

![Example 5) Typing numbers in transaction data field — (read-msg)](/assets/blog/1_XhMjw9Mq1iYhZa8mgINXRw.webp)

PactNumber provides the functions to format numbers in decimal or integer
objects that Pact expects in the data field: `toPactDecimal()` and
`toPactInteger()` .

## Big Number

Lastly, PactNumber solves a big issue that builders often struggle with
—operating with numbers in Javascript that are out of safe number range.

Number operations in smart contracts often involve big decimal points that
Javascript cannot safely handle. PactNumber uses bignumber.js library and allow
users to store and handle big number values safely.

## What’s coming next?

Coming next with PactNumber is number operations.
