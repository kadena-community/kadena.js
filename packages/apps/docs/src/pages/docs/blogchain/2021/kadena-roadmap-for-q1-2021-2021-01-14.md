## Kadena Roadmap for Q1 2021

Moving forward in 2021, the team is tracking dramatic shifts in the crypto
markets, providing us with helpful data for (re)focusing. We believe that
economic infrastructure adds the most value to Kadena at this time. Looking at
the year ahead, major initiatives include the full launch of the Kadenaswap DEX
alongside decentralized bridges to Ethereum and wrapped KDA. We’ll also continue
working towards additional exchange listings and community-led efforts (DAOs).

With your support, Kadena reached major milestones in 2020.

As previously shared with the community, we’re starting off the year with the
launch of Kadenaswap “Bountyswap” on mainnet. Mainnet functionality will include
wallet connection and token swaps as well as pool liquidity and statistics. The
swapping and pooling of cryptocurrency token pairs is enabled in a familiar
AMM-style DEX. Bountyswap will have pre-funded pools using a KDA-linked “KPenny”
token with overall funding up to 100,000 KDA. This provides a bounty for
“white-hat hacking” to find vulnerabilities in the new DEX, as any funds
received through an exploit can be kept at the end of the Bountyswap program.

Economic infrastructure development has already begun with
[support for Ethereum bridge proofs](https://twitter.com/SirLensALot/status/1348435372565549056/photo/1)
included in Chainweb 2.4. Upcoming milestones for the first quarter include
launching an Ethereum bridge relay program, integrating a ZelCore DEX with
Kadenaswap, and releasing an Ethereum bridge. An Ethereum bridge allows for
wrapped KDA, compatible with any Ethereum-based protocol, to become available by
the end of the quarter.

After speaking with investors, miners, and other community members, the team is
currently working on publishing a new token economics document in addition to
modifying the platform emissions structure. We believe the updates will make our
token economics easier to understand and demonstrate how the incentives are
aligned among all Kadena platform participants.

We appreciate constructive comments, questions, and suggestions about Kadena.
