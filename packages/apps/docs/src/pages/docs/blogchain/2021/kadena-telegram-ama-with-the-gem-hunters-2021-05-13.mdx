## Kadena Telegram AMA with The Gem Hunters, May 13 2021 Transcript

## Opening Remarks

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Welcome to the Kadena Live AMA with
[The Gem Hunters (TGH)](https://t.me/TheGemHuntersTG), we would like to thank
the team and community for coming today, and can‚Äôt wait to find out more about
Kadena!

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Welcome Stuart üòÑ excited for the AMA today ü•≥.

**Comrade Pandah Sama (TGH):** Welcome Stuart pleasure to have you. People on
Telegram and Twitter were euphoric about you, so I‚Äôm curious to find out more.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Hi great to be here!

## Questions and Answers

## Kadena‚Äôs Progress

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Most of us have probably heard of Kadena, as you guys have
been around for a while now and are well respected within the crypto sphere,
it‚Äôs a pleasure to have you guys here at TGH, so to kick off this AMA we would
love an overview on what you guys have been doing over at Kadena!

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Thanks! 2021 has been a busy year üôÇ . Most
recently we listed on Kucoin which was very exciting. As a multi-chain, sharded
blockchain, there‚Äôs a little more to integrating with us than just another
ERC-20. Otherwise, we‚Äôre working toward a rebrand of our DEX, Kadenaswap, which
completed a ‚Äúlive beta‚Äù with the essential help of our community

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Oh yeah we saw that, massive congrats!

**Comrade Pandah Sama (TGH):** Multi-Chain sharded blockchain already sounds
super impressive.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Right? I read that originally and had to re-read to
make sure haha.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, that‚Äôs the thing right? Blockchain needs to
scale to take all this amazing innovation into the future. We‚Äôre huge fans of
what Ethereum has achieved, and we want to turbocharge that: smart contracts,
digital value, decentralization, security. But we‚Äôre also huge fans of Bitcoin‚Äôs
original innovation too, which is why we scaled Proof-of-Work.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** You‚Äôve kind of took the best of both and tried to make it
better.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Really well said, taking the major parts of the two
biggest players to make a better version.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** It‚Äôs true even with smart contracts. Pact, the
smart contract language on Kadena, brings some elements of Bitcoin script back
to meld with the power of a full language such as Solidity. Namely, being
Turing-incomplete ‚Ä¶ but also offering powerful native functions. Remember, with
Bitcoin script you can verify a signature with a single bytecode. Pact gives
really powerful native functions so that you use less gas, and write fewer bugs.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** That‚Äôs a cool bonus, so Pact is also a best of both
worlds type of deal, taking code from both Bitcoin and Solidity (ETH)

## Kadena‚Äôs Team

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Now we have a basic understanding of the project itself,
we would love to get to know the team behind the scenes. By the way, we are
simply blown away by how extensive and legitimate your team is, the experience
and qualifications are unbelievable, it‚Äôs not something we‚Äôre used to seeing
often in this space! Please do share some information with us about some of the
key team members, advisors, and how you guys operate along with some of your
experience! [Team page](https://www.kadena.io/team).

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, it all starts with Will Martino and myself.
We built the JP Morgan blockchain group in late 2014, which was really important
to get to know all of the players at the time. We had everybody coming in
because everybody wanted to talk to JPM: Vitalik, R3, IBM ‚Ä¶

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Unbelievable.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Interestingly, after founding, one of the first
people we worked with was Stuart Haber, who helped us formalize our security
proofs for chainweb. Chainweb is the name of the protocol that runs our sharded
public blockchain. He also was involved in us picking Blake2S for our hashing
algorithm. He‚Äôs a beast.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** I‚Äôm stunned haha.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Those are major players in the space (both crypto and
tech in general).

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Definitely one of the most legit teams we‚Äôve had here at
TGH. A pleasure to have you guys here.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Most importantly, he gets our vision, which is to
make incremental engineering leaps to achieve a big goal: scalable POW.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Has anyone achieved POW scalability yet?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** We‚Äôre it. Other solutions use layer 2. But again,
we were working with ideas that had shown up in the Bitcoin community: Betacoin,
Blockrope. People had already wondered ‚Äúwhat if Bitcoin had 2 chains instead of
one?‚Äù

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** By the way, I heard that he is cited in the bitcoin
whitepaper, is that correct?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Yes, Stuart Haber is the most-cited author in the
Satoshi white paper. He‚Äôs been running a blockchain in the
[NY Times classified since 1996](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain)!!
So when Satoshi says ‚Äúlike the NY Times classified‚Äù in the paper, that‚Äôs not
just a random metaphor üòÇ

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Wait seriously?

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** So he‚Äôs been running blockchain since before
‚Äúblockchain‚Äù was the name haha

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** TIL (today I learned), holy crap haha.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Need to fill my bags.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** We also have a number of heavies from the Haskell
programming language on our team, hailing from Microsoft and Google. The Pact
lead engineer,
[Emily Pillmore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-pillmore-453630ab/), is now
the CTO of the Haskell Foundation alongside her duties at Kadena.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** That‚Äôs a legendary shout-out to Haber in the BTC
Whitepaper haha.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** But yeah, Stuart Haber is heavy. We‚Äôre working with
him on our decentralized bridge design currently.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** The rest of the team is fully of heavyweights too, CTO
of Haskell is massive and Microsoft and Google kind of speak for themselves
haha.

## Why Proof Of Work

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** One thing you guys are known for is your steadfast passion
and commitment to building a scalable and developer-friendly public blockchain
that provides a level of security similar to Bitcoin. Before we move onto your
groundbreaking research and development please tell us why you believe a
scalable PoW is so groundbreaking, the fact nobody else has managed to create
one, you are obviously onto something big, can you please enlighten us as to why
a scalable POW is so groundbreaking and game-changing?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, again, credit where it‚Äôs due: Adam Back
proposed ‚ÄúBetacoin‚Äù in 2014 as a way to have a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù bitcoin that would have
real BTC to play with. This is what led to Lightning network ‚Äî they decided at
the time that forking Bitcoin to two chains would be impossible from a
fork-politics perspective.

The main innovation of Kadena is figuring out how to add more than 2 or 3
chains. Betacoin would have had every block on one chain witness the previous on
the other. Once you get to 4 or 5 chains this would start slowing down the
network.

![Our current network graph](/assets/blog/0_yAzO8qUbpvvC0job.png)

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** I assume this is just due to the overwhelming data
required to reference the past blocks on the other chains?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** So, what you‚Äôll notice here is that while 20 chains
are operating, they only have to interact with 2 other chains. Plus, it‚Äôs at
most 2 hops to get to any other chain. This means that up to 3 block heights can
be mined at once, chains can nudge ahead or behind each other a little, but the
whole network makes steady progress.

What‚Äôs amazing is, given the right graph, this scales to 50, 100, 1000, even
100,000 chains. At that point, bandwidth gets a little crazy. But it essentially
means throughput can always go up.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** It‚Äôs eye-opening because this is the future of blockchain.
We were talking about how cheap Kadena still is.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Trying to understand the picture a little better haha
they‚Äôre all within a maximum of 4 layers of separation minimum of 2 which is
super cool, and extremely scalable

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** It‚Äôs definitely just the beginning. But bringing on
Kucoin is essential. We have a great partner to ensure liquidity.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** And you gain more exposure.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** To be honest, we‚Äôve had great partners all along.
CoinMetro will be helping us with our bonding program, and Zelcore wallet
provides a seamless wallet experience for Kadenaswap and other apps.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** You‚Äôre already working with Polkadot and Web3, but what
about ETH? Have you had any dealing with ETH yet?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** We‚Äôre bridging to ETH as we speak. Plus, Tokensoft
Wrapped is bringing kETH and kBTC to Kadena via Anchorage bank, for Kadenaswap,
which is huge. The bonding program in fact is to reward bonders for providing
economic security for the Ethereum bridge. It will be a true generalized bridge
too, so it will be able to do NFTs and any crypto asset, not just tokens.

## Kadena‚Äôs Partnerships: Polkadot, Celo, Terra, Tokensoft/Wrapped

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Oh. I‚Äôve got a question about partnerships. Kadena has
already partnered with Web3 Foundation and Polkadot as well as other huge
players. In the space and you‚Äôve already spoken about a potential bridge to
Polkadot in which KadenaDot will act as a bridge technology between the Polkadot
and Kadena ecosystem, we all know how big Polkadot is right now, sounds
exciting, you‚Äôve also partnered with Celo, Terra, and Tokensoft/Wrapped. What
can you tell us about some of the partnerships and progress so far?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, what‚Äôs great is these are all super-strong
teams themselves.

Take Terra, they have done so much to make crypto actually usable for consumers
in the Korean market. Our goal there is actually to give Terra/LUNA holders more
ways to use their tokens, right out of the Terra wallet. First by being able to
trade with zero fees on Kadenaswap!

With Polkadot, we‚Äôre engaged with multiple efforts. First is the Core Pact
initiative, which brings our smart contract language Pact to Polkadot as a
_native_ smart contract language. But we‚Äôre also going to bridge there too, to
bring DOT and KSM to Kadenaswap. Once Pact is live on Polkadot, we can even see
Kadenaswap using Polkadot as ‚Äújust another chain‚Äù, meaning users will be able to
not just trade but settle, on multiple platforms.

Same for Cosmos, where we have completed ‚ÄúKadenamint‚Äù which allows Pact to be
used on a Cosmos chain.

**The future of Kadenaswap is a single market on Kadena, Cosmos, and Polkadot.
It will be like stocks in the US, where you can trade on NYSE or NASDAQ or like
9 other exchanges, but functioning as a single market.**

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** That‚Äôs dope, multi-chain swaps would be huge. That
sounds incredible. Right now you have to bounce between like 5 platforms to make
trades sometimes. Those 3 chains combine would be huge.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Agreed.

## Kadena‚Äôs Upcoming Multi-Platform DEX

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** We are also truly fascinated about your plans to
create a multi-platform DEX plus the chain relay program, what chains will you
incorporate and how far off is this from being competed? Can you give us any
sneak peeks or insider information on the progress of the DEX?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, what‚Äôs really exciting is that the DEX will
be spinning off to become its own entity soon, with its own token. This will
allow it to have its own governance and be able to pursue a UNI-like incentive
program aggressively.

Chains we plan to bridge to are:** Ethereum, Terra, Celo, Polkadot/Kusama**.
Ethereum is first, and will also mean a wrapped KDA will be available in Uniswap
and other ETH DEX platforms. But we‚Äôre also excited to bring over tokens to
Kadenaswap, like DAI. The Ethereum bridge is already in testnet, with support
for Ethereum proofs already in production.

Comrade Keegan (TGH): Alright I‚Äôm excited for all of those haha those are major
ecosystems all being brought together. How close to releasing the dex are you?
I‚Äôd be interested in trying it out üëÄ.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena)**: Well, you can already try it out in
[testnet](https://beta.kadenaswap.chainweb.com/) :). We just finished our public
beta in prod, but will probably do another one to try out new features before
launch. The goal is the end of Q2 to launch, but we want to be sure there is
sufficient liquidity at launch, so it will depend on that. In other words, we
will launch with real volumes so that trades will be efficient.

We also might ‚Äúpre-launch‚Äù though with KDA and other native tokens sooner
though. We‚Äôll be saying a lot more about our go-to-market for Kadenaswap very
soon üòâ.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** I‚Äôll be trying out the testnet today, nice.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Keegan bullish.

**Comrade Pandah Sama (TGH):** Can‚Äôt blame him, just bought a decent bag myself.

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** Nice.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Rosetta is Coinbase‚Äôs effort to standardize
exchange integrations, and we were an early partner with that. It‚Äôs a noble
cause, as I was saying before if you‚Äôre anything but an ERC-20 these days it‚Äôs a
big effort for exchanges to take on a new protocol. Rosetta addresses that.
However, only Coinbase supports it, and even there it‚Äôs a slow start.

Coinbase is famously impossible to predict, so I would love to say that with our
completed Rosetta implementation, we‚Äôre listing tomorrow!!! But in fact, we are
in the dark, like every other project, even though we stay in touch on Rosetta
issues.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** That‚Äôs incredible though, because you‚Äôre right, with
95% of dApps built on ERC-20‚Äôs, it‚Äôs hard for other chains to get integrated.
Great stuff working with Rosetta üí™

**Bit Shaman (TGH):** You guys have made some huge partnerships

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):**

![Sneak preview of KADDEX](/assets/blog/0_1Xjmvmiln6PFldqm.png)

(KadDEX is the super-secret new name for Kadenaswap, don‚Äôt tell anyone üòé)

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Sick name not gonna lie. Before the last question,
just wanted to give a huge thanks for attending today. Haven‚Äôt been this bullish
in a long time haha

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Totally! Thank you for having me. We want everybody
to know about Kadena ‚Äî or more like, we want everybody to know about Kadena
before everybody knows about Kadena üòâ

## Kadena‚Äôs Short Term and Long Term Goals

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** To finish off, can you give us all an insight into
what we can look forward to short term and long term? What can we expect to see
in near future from Kadena, your roadmap is fascinating and we have no doubt
you‚Äôre knocking off catalysts, you just listed on Kucoin which is impressive, is
this the start of mass adoption, and is Kadena finally getting the exposure it
deserves? Here‚Äôs the
[Q2 roadmap](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadena-roadmap-for-q2-2021-610ccde02fe0)
for anyone who‚Äôs interested too.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, the main thing is that Kadena is going to be
everywhere this year. We‚Äôre launching every use-case in crypto, whether it‚Äôs
tokens, DEXs, NFT, lending platforms, and enterprise use-cases so that
developers will be able to learn from successful models to bring the next wave
of innovation. KDA is now on Kucoin with more exchanges to come, and wKDA will
be on Uniswap and other DEXes. While we‚Äôre sure Kadena has the most powerful
platform, we‚Äôre not going to wait around for folks to stumble on it but instead
launch the best dApps, so that users can be empowered with the security of PoW
but no gas fees!

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Build it and they will come üòé

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, Kadenaswap alone is resonating in a huge way.
For instance, Tokensoft talks about settling all of their wrapped coins on
Kadenaswap someday. The idea of a scalable PoW settlement platform is too
powerful. **Today, we can settle the entire US stock market without breaking a
sweat on 20 chains. Kadenaswap and other markets will be able to grow without
limit but also without gas prices creeping up.**

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** You can settle the entire US stock market using 20
chains? What, that‚Äôs insane scalability lol

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well and it matters. Look at gas prices on Pancake
‚Äî it‚Äôs not just Ethereum.

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Every chain you add after 20, I assume increases
scalability exponentially.

**Comrade Pandah Sama (TGH):** 100% agree, BSC is also non stop congested these
days.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** It‚Äôs really interesting how the scaling works, I
recommend
[Doug‚Äôs article](https://medium.com/kadena-io/how-to-scale-a-proof-of-work-blockchain-9233e5b4b62)
for the deep dive (Doug is our Director of Engineering).

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Thanks mate, will definitely give a read

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** A big thank again from TGH for attending today üôè
honor to have you here; you ready to answer community questions?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Absolutely!

## Community Questions and Answers

**Lah:** Yield farming is a popular topic since the origin of DeFi, yet it has
never withstood a bear market. What will happen to the yield for KadenaSwap?
Will it remain stable? Since KadenaSwap is dependent on other yield-farming
mechanisms, would that mean its yield decreases as well?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** I think ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù per se will yield (sorry)
to less frothy income streams. For instance,
[bonding with KDA](https://medium.com/kadena-io/announcing-the-kadena-chain-relay-a801a2756036)
for the relay is based on providing an essential service, in true crypto style:
you make money but you‚Äôre also putting your KDA to work with real value. That‚Äôs
not to say folks shouldn‚Äôt maximize gains and rebalance, but there should be
more to it than just yield.

**Single:** Ethereum gas costs are really high but for example, Binance smart
chain gas prices are so small and it is faster. In the future can you implement
BSC?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** See above üôÇ BSC isn‚Äôt free anymore. Even
fast-finality chains will have gas problems if they can‚Äôt scale past their
initial throughput. The only way you keep gas costs down is to be able to scale
to any load. Kadena is the only blockchain, PoS or PoW, that can do this.

**N:** How does KDA fit the bill regarding the recent accusations about BTC
being inefficient in energy consumption? What makes KDA better and more
sustainable in comparison to other alternatives?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Well, BTC _is_ inefficient, there‚Äôs no question
about that. BTC hashpower is crazily high, well past any sane security
requirement. Kadena is different: we can run 10, 20, 100, 1000 chains _without
increasing the hash rate_. While it sounds crazy, Kadena gets _more secure_ the
more chains run on it, with hashpower remaining constant. If BTC‚Äôs increasing
hashrate actually benefitted humanity, we could discuss how to manage its
impact. But as it is, it‚Äôs just wasting energy, which is a problem.

**Kenny Kimora:\* \***I wanted to follow your project for the long term. Where
can I get all the latest news about your project? Do you have
Twitter/Telegram/Discord community? If yes, can you share the link here because
there is a lot of fake Telegram/Twitter groups?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Please be sure to follow us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/kadena_io), [Telegram](https://t.me/kadena_io), and
[Discord](http://discord.io/kadena) for project updates!

**Me Armor 20:** Are you a community-based project? How can I work for the
success of your project? Do you have a Global Ambassador Program or a Referral
Rewards System?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Yes, we launched our
[Ambassador Program](https://www.kadena.io/ambassador-program) which has been a
huge success, thanks to the hard work of team member Jeff!

ùó¶ùóÆùóªùóÆùó±ùóÆ | ùóñùó£ùóñ: Hello sir. As we know, that when the NFT was booming and a lot of
people supported this. But, many artists/creators still don‚Äôt clearly understand
NFT especially since there is still a lack of editing platforms, people still
don‚Äôt know much how to make their own NFT and the cost of gas especially in
Ethereum-based tokens is very high. How do you solve this problem?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** NFT is too expensive for the independent artist or
musician, but also, it‚Äôs too hard to customize the NFT experience to create
innovative cash flows/royalty models. We are launching multiple NFT projects on
Kadena in the upcoming months where you‚Äôll start to see what a more equitable
NFT model looks like. But most importantly, NO GAS. Content creators shouldn‚Äôt
have to pay an inexplicable huge tax to mint NFTs.

**Aurellia:** Who is your targeted customer? Besides Blockchain user do you have
plan for non-crypto users too? If yes how can you attract them or what is your
plan to attract them?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** I think blockchain has to get to non-crypto users
to really reach its true potential. The main way you attract non-cryptos is to
solve three problems: usability, security, and volatility. Crypto today is hard
to use, you can lose money if you‚Äôre not super-careful/DYOR, and prices scare
away non-speculators. There are solutions to all of these problems, for
instance, if you look at more mature markets like stocks you can see how they
manage crazy volatility. But gas is another issue: if users have to pay some
random fee, they‚Äôre going to turn away from it.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Thanks everybody! Great to connect with the Gem
Hunters community!

**Comrade Keegan (TGH):** Was a pleasure to have you here mates!
