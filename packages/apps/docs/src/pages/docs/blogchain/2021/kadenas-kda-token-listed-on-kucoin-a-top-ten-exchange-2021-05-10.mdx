## Kadena’s KDA Token Listed on Kucoin, a Top Ten Exchange

**NEW YORK, UNITED STATES, May 10, 2021** — We are proud to announce that
Kadena, the safest and most scalable Proof of Work blockchain, will have its
first major listing of 2021 on [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/). Kucoin is a
Top Ten exchange based on its trading volume as measured on cryptocurrency
tracking apps such
as[ CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) and
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges).

The Kadena token (KDA) secures the Kadena public blockchain through
Proof-of-Work, and is used to fund gas costs on the network in a similar manner
to Ethereum. Thanks to Kadena’s scalable Proof-of-Work algorithm, congestion is
a thing of the past which keeps gas fees affordable, and with
[Gas Stations](https://medium.com/kadena-io/the-first-crypto-gas-station-is-now-on-kadenas-blockchain-6dc43b4b3836),
projects can subsidize gas fees to remove that complexity entirely from the user
experience. Apps on Kadena are powered by smart contracts written in Pact, which
avoids the
[bugs and vulnerabilities](../2018/the-evm-is-fundamentally-unsafe-2018-12-13)
found in Solidity and other smart contract languages.

### Kadena’s Listing on Kucoin

KDA trading pairs on Kucoin will launch with Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).
This listing improves access to liquidity for KDA community members across the
world. Kadena and Kucoin will be announcing a joint marketing campaign on May
11th.

**The KDA wallet is now launched on Kucoin for deposits and withdrawals. The
marketing launch and trading will open on Tuesday, May 11th, at 10 UTC / 6 AM
EST.**

### About Kadena

that delivers groundbreaking security and throughput. With Kadena’s Kuro Layer-2
solution transaction speed can exceed 480,000 TPS. Smart contracts written in

Besides Kadena’s listing on Kucoin, we have many exciting projects launching
into production in [Q2 of 2021](./kadena-roadmap-for-q2-2021-04-05) such as:

- Launching the very
  [first multi-protocol DEX](./introducing-kadenaswap-bountyswap-live-beta-2021-02-02)
  with free gas, which will provide an attractive off-ramp from Ethereum for
  projects and users looking for lower gas fees as well as tokens from Polkadot,
  Terra, Celo, ViteX, and other protocols.

- Developing a
  [chain relay program](./announcing-the-kadena-chain-relay-2021-03-25) to
  secure Kadena decentralized bridges to Ethereum, Celo, Terra, and other
  platforms, powered by bonding KDA.

- Announcing an NFT project on Kadena’s blockchain, which will showcase Kadena’s
  ability to scale and maintain lower fees than any of our competitors.

“KDA will be everywhere by the end of 2021, whether that’s Uniswap or major
exchanges or wrapped platforms,” says Kadena’s Founder and CEO Stuart Popejoy.
