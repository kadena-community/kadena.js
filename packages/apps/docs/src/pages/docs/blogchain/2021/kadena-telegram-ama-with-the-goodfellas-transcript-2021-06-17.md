## Kadena Telegram AMA with The Goodfellas, June 11 2021 Transcript

## Opening Remarks

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Welcome To another GoodFellas AMA. Today, we are joined
today by the team of Kadena: Jeffrey, Francesco, Stuart, and Doug. Can we start
with intros? What are your backgrounds/experiences both in the traditional and
crypto spaces?

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** Hey all! I am running business development
and was previously an engineer at Kadena. Before Kadena, I founded and sold a
startup in the robotics space. Here today to support DA UPSETTAAA Stuart Popejoy
üòé.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** A pleasure to have you here Francesco!

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** My name is Stuart Popejoy and I‚Äôm the CEO of
Kadena! My background is coming from 25 years in software and 15 years in
financial building exchanges and trading systems, before switching to blockchain
in 2014 when I led the JP Morgan blockchain team. That‚Äôs where I met my
co-founder Will Martino who was tech lead of the project, and we created Kadena
in 2016 to bring industrial-strength software to blockchain ‚Äî stuff powerful
enough to clear all the world‚Äôs assets, but safe and easy enough that
non-programmers could write and understand smart contracts without being
terrified of mysterious bugs and exploits. At Kadena, we built an incredible
team that launched the world‚Äôs only Scalable Proof-of-Work blockchain, and now
we‚Äôre helping launch game-changing apps like Kaddex, the multi-protocol,
multi-chain DEX.

**Jeffrey Ou (Kadena):** Hi everyone, I‚Äôm the Operations/Community manager at
Kadena. You‚Äôll probably see me around in our official
[Telegram ](http://t.me/kadena_io)channel and
[Discord](http://discord.io/kadena).

## Questions and Answers

## Kadena Overview

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Wow you guys are rockstars in crypto. We‚Äôre pumped to
be here! For those of our members that may be unfamiliar, can you please give a
brief overview of what Kadena is all about?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena)**: Kadena is all about bringing real-world scalability
to blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, by leveraging the proven
unbeatable security and reliability of Proof-of-Work with real scalability as
the only sharded PoW blockchain, and offering a full solution for
industrial-scale apps: fast finality via our Kuro permissioned blockchain, and
safe and secure apps with Pact, our smart contract language. This has allowed
developers to build in record time, which is why we have launched DEXes, tokens
and NFT exchanges since going live in January 2020. Our team is unmatched,
including luminaries like Stuart Haber who provided critical skills in
developing the multi-chain security model and who now advises on crypto
interaction protocols in Pact. Kadena is the only blockchain that can settle all
the world‚Äôs assets and is the future of digital value.

**The Goodfellas (GF)**: Wow that‚Äôs a lot to take in. As a crypto nerd, I‚Äôm
totally star-struck by the reference of Stuart Haber. In our world‚Ä¶that‚Äôs
celebrity status.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** He‚Äôs the real deal. In addition to the namechecks
in the Satoshi paper he built the
[first blockchain in 1996](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain)
‚Ä¶ using the NY times classifieds to record hashes of documents. So when Satoshi
says ‚Äúwe need a source of truth like the NY Times Classifieds‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt just
a metaphor üòÇ.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Truly amazing‚Ä¶.and to think you guys have access to
such a brilliant mind.

## Why Proof-of-Work?

**The Goodfellas (GF):** There‚Äôs been so much focus on moving away from POW but
yet that‚Äôs where your focus is? Can you explain why POW over others? Also, what
exactly does ‚Äúscalable POW‚Äù mean?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Scalable POW means a Proof-of-Work blockchain like
Bitcoin or Ethereum that ALWAYS can handle an ever-increasing transaction load
by increasing capacity. We launched with 10 ‚Äúbraided chains‚Äù and in August 2020
scaled to 20, doubling throughput without using any additional hash power. We
can scale without limit, bounded only by bandwidth: 100, 1000, or 100,000
chains. So for your hashrate, you‚Äôre getting ever-increased efficiency as
utilization grows.

All this, while _increasing_ the proven security of single-chain Proof of Work
blockchains. This is why we worked with folks like Stuart Haber and Tarun Chitra
to ensure the security was rock solid.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Ok so if no additional hash power is needed, then am I
correct in assuming that the energy consumption doesn‚Äôt increase? And if it
doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶..then have you guys been in touch with some of the newsmakers in crypto
(i.e. Elon)?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** This is also how we can make PoW green too,
expanding on the model from the Square whitepaper. By keeping PoW _efficient_,
we encourage more sustainable models for mining and utilizing excess grid energy
efficiently. Who is this ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúElon‚Äù you speak of?

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Ok, I think I asked before you were finished
responding..sorry for that. But this is great info!

Oh just this guy who‚Äôs been making waves in Crypto. But joking aside, you‚Äôre
solving a huge problem.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Hehe. Oh, he‚Äôs the doge guy? OK, I‚Äôll stop. I
actually appreciate his focus on crypto, between that and NFTs 2021 has been a
great year for crypto.

## Kadena and Energy Efficiency

**The Goodfellas (GF):** I was just listening to Elizabeth Warren talking about
turning away from digital currencies that are not eco-friendly so it is a
real-world adoption concern.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** What‚Äôs important to realize is, if Bitcoin was
scalable, we‚Äôd be settling the stock market on it and arguing about
supercharging renewable mining. The real problem is that Bitcoin and Ethereum
are _inefficient_ so increased hashrate accomplishes nothing but waste (past a
minimum security level).

With Kadena, increasing utilization => more efficiency => more value to society,
encouraging productive engagement with mining, which, unlike traditional mining,
benefits from grid excess and renewables. Power companies could be green mining
their spare energy and passing savings to consumers.

**The Goodfellas (GF)**: I can see that and with your solution, this can really
be a game-changer. Especially for politicians who want to support crypto but
can‚Äôt because of energy consumption concerns. The more value to society would
encourage more adoption‚Ä¶brilliant!

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** The thing is, mining gives real fundamentals to the
currency and this allows for _economic security_. Whereas Proof-of-Stake systems
encourage _insecurity_, especially when there is a lot of leverage or competing
demand from yield. Proof-of-Work tokens are the best coins for financial
engineering because you‚Äôll never upset the liquidity regime of the mining token.

## Kadena‚Äôs Partnerships

**The Goodfellas (GF):** I was unaware of this. So this would mean they‚Äôre ideal
for DeFi. Who are some of the key new partnerships that you‚Äôve had and how will
they help Kadena?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** We‚Äôll hear from our head of BD, Francesco, for that
one üôÇ

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena)**: Yesterday we had our first 3rd party DeFi
protocol, KADDEX, launch a token sale on Kadena, which has been a huge success
thus far. We also recently partnered with API3, an awesome decentralized oracle
data provider. We actually had an ama with their community yesterday that you
can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItL0ZCbpRjY).

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Sweet! I‚Äôm all about DeFi and passive income. Will
definitely check this out! Thanks for sharing.

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** We are looking to expand our wallet ecosystem
to make things as easy as possible for users to interact with dApps. On that
front, we recently announced a partnership with Torus, a wallet that lets you
sign Kadena transactions with a simple social single sign-on. Similar to ‚Äòlogin
with google‚Äô authentication that people are accustomed to everywhere in the web2
world.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Interesting‚Ä¶and anything that makes the user experience
easier is better for mainstream adoption.

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** We are planning on making the user experience
as seamless as using any web2 application, and this is only possible because of
Kadena‚Äôs gas stations (Read
[here](https://medium.com/kadena-io/the-first-crypto-gas-station-is-now-on-kadenas-blockchain-6dc43b4b3836)),
where a contract can pay for a user‚Äôs gas. This means that a user interacting
with blockchain doesn‚Äôt even necessarily need to know he is doing so, and thus
not have to go through the annoyance of buying eth from an exchange and passing
KYC etc etc.

## Gas Stations and Adoption

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Ahh, that was going to be my next question. I didn‚Äôt
quite understand what the ‚Äúgas station‚Äù reference was. So then this solves the
gas problem?

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** We need to understand that it is quite a
steep learning curve for your average user to even use Metamask, so it‚Äôs not
enough to make fancier UI‚Äôs to attract users. The blockchain that the smart
contract code lives on needs to inherently scale. There is only so much a
frontend dev can do.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** 100% agree with this statement.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Kadena solves the gas problem in its entirety.
First, apps can subsidize user gas. This is critical for UX, the user should
never even know what gas is. Second, apps can do so in a way that e.g. involves
a gas token, allowing for risk management and financial engineering so that
companies can plan for utilization costs. But the final and most important thing
is, being a scalable platform so that gas fees NEVER get out of control in the
first place.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** This is such an important point. I hold $ETH but
sometimes I wonder how much I want it to rise because if it rises, then gas
prices always seem to get worse.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Because Ethereum isn‚Äôt the only chain with a gas
problem. Binance Smart Chain is way faster but still not scalable, so now
Pancake Swap is contending with rising gas prices with no limit.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Yeah I noticed that as well. So scalability does seem
to be the key driver in addressing a lot of concerns

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Scalability means ‚Äú**increase capacity along with
load**‚Äù. Not ‚Äú**start with a bunch and hope it doesn‚Äôt run out**‚Äù.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Wow, you can make a T-shirt with that slogan. It hits
home.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** This applies to Solana and Ava, and even though
Cosmos and Polkadot are ‚Äúsharded‚Äù they aren‚Äôt actually scaled ‚Äî each chain is
more or less independent.

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** To me all these EVM clone chains that just
came into the world suspiciously remind me of the many bitcoin ‚Äòimproved forks‚Äô
of the past bull run. All those chains inevitably are fizzling away since they
did not really innovate or solve any problems. It‚Äôs easy enough to change 3
lines of code and spend millions on marketing, not so easy to redesign a
blockchain system from the ground up to fundamentally solve all the problems
that are emerging today and will only get worse as adoption goes up.

But this is inevitable as actually reading the whitepaper is an extremely
complicated affair. I‚Äôll bet you even employees at some of these new proof of
stake blockchains do not understand how their consensus algorithm works. There
is one key takeaway from all proof-of-stake whitepapers though, there is a HUGE
assumption, that 2/3 + 1 of the network needs to be honest actors. Good luck
with that in the long run. proof of work is maths, proof of stake is behavioral
economics. What would you trust to settle all of the world‚Äôs digital value?

**The Goodfellas (GF):** That‚Äôs a possibility ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I didn‚Äôt realize the security
aspects of POS. This is a very good point and one that the common user doesn‚Äôt
think of. Right now people see the hype and ‚Äòassume‚Äô that it must be the right
answer because everyone is talking about it.

## NFTs on Kadena

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Can you elaborate on how you will be incorporating
NFT‚Äôs into the Kadena ecosystem? I wasn‚Äôt clear on that.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** NFTs on Kadena benefit from the most innovative
thinking on NFTs reflected in our standard, the ‚Äúpoly fungible‚Äù token. This
takes ERC-1155 and incorporates fractional ownership. Plus we‚Äôre working on an
_exchange standard_, which is how things like royalties can be actually
enforceable no matter what NFT exchange you‚Äôre on. We have a new NFT market
launched by a developer from the KDA community using these great standards and
are bringing other projects on as we speak.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Wow you guys have literally thought of everything.

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** We‚Äôre excited about fractionals! This is how NFTs
can really become _equity_ for creators and even fans.

## Purpose of the KDA Token

**The Goodfellas (GF):** I can see that! Ok, now let‚Äôs get into the use case for
the $KDA token. Why would I need to buy $KDA?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** Why do you use any crypto (beyond speculation)?
Because you can access it readily because you can loan or borrow it easily
because you can tap into new cash flows. KDA is the best protocol for DeFi
because AMMs will always be able to provide liquidity (and be rewarded for it),
borrowers can always find lenders, and other protocols can leverage it in sales
and other fungible activity. As Kadena grows and brings more solutions to the
market, KDA will provide essential utility to everybody using Kadena.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** I can see your use cases growing so getting in at these
levels could be advantageous.

## Kadena‚Äôs Community

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Community is such a strong aspect of crypto now‚Ä¶.How
strong is the Kadena community?

**Jeffrey Ou (Kadena):** I think we have the best community out there. They
really care about the tech and what we stand for and I think that speaks
volumes. I think they truly understand that blockchain has a place in the world
and we‚Äôre the only project that can fit the shoes of what the world needs.

**Doug Beardsley (Kadena):** Hi, Kadena‚Äôs Director of Engineering here‚Ä¶we‚Äôve
seen the community really step up in recent months with all kinds of initiatives
that are making a really significant difference. They‚Äôre a great group of
talented and knowledgeable people who appreciate the scope and significance of
what we‚Äôve built and the potential in the ecosystem

**The Goodfellas (GF):** What a great answer! With that said, Does the community
have any kind of an impact or vote on Kadena‚Äôs direction?

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** The community has already stepped up in the form of
actively engaging with projects like the Kadenaswap public beta. This month
we‚Äôre launching a DAO for strategic projects and community members will be
directly involved. Finally, things like our bridge are actually bonded by KDA
holders taking risks to provide security, generating a return on that bond.
Crypto is run by the community really, and Kadena tries to listen to its
community at all times.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Incredibly important to listen to the community. Glad
you guys recognize that.

**Upcoming Milestones**

**The Goodfellas (GF):** What important milestones are coming up for Kadena that
you would like to highlight and make our members aware of?

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** The DAO will also give a great chance to our
community to deploy some marketing funds on our behalf. Stay tuned!

**Doug Beardsley (Kadena):** One upcoming milestone that I‚Äôm excited about is
that we‚Äôre working on upcoming integration with the Ledger hardware wallet. We
know that having more secure wallet options is something that is important to a
lot of users and it will be good to get familiar security devices working with
Kadena.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** That‚Äôs great! Something I myself need to get more
familiar with so I‚Äôll be paying attention.

**Francesco Melpignano (Kadena):** Well we had our biggest 3rd party project
launch on Kadena just yesterday!! This is super exciting for us to see that our
technology is getting leveraged to its full potential

**Stuart Popejoy (Kadena):** The public beta of Kaddex is launching very soon,
and full launch will bring Tokensoft kBTC and kETH tokens going live alongside
KDA and native tokens, with massive participation from liquidity providers and
innovative structures and solutions for impermanent loss, single-token
provision, MEV, all leading to higher fees for AMMs and a better experience for
the user.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Wow this is huge! Please feel free to share links to
your Announcements channel and other social links so we can stay up to date. I
know our members would greatly appreciate that.

our members can purchase KDA if they are indeed interested?

**Jeffrey Ou (Kadena):** You can purchase KDA on Kucoin, Coinmetro, and Bittrex
Global üôÇ.

**The Goodfellas (GF):** Perfect. Well, this has been a very educational and
informative AMA. I learned a lot about POW & even the weaknesses of POS that I
really didn‚Äôt pay attention to. I will definitely keep this project on my radar
and hopefully so will our members. Thank you for your time today and I wish you
the best of luck. With that said, the AMA is now complete.
