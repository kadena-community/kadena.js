## Q2 Roadmap Key Milestones

As we’ve previously hinted in our last
[AMA](./kadena-telegram-ama-with-stuart-popejoy-2021-03-29), some of our major
milestones for Q2 will be:

- Major Exchange Listing in early Q2

- Full re-skin/re-brand of Kadenaswap, and a Kadena.io website refresh

- Launch of Kadenaswap with Tokensoft kETH and kBTC, KDA, and at least one major
  new Kadena native token

- Production Chain Relay launch for Ethereum Bridge, and testnet bridges to
  Terra and/or Celo

- Wrapped KDA on Ethereum with market maker participation for listing in Uniswap
  and other DEXes

- Launch a new DAO focused on new initiatives on the Kadena platform and
  leveraging the Kadena treasury

- At least one NFT project launches on Kadena platform, and at least one major
  wallet integration completed

- Pact 4.0 with great new features to speed smart contract development and
  testing

Q1 2021 showed the world that Kadena, scalable POW, and smart contracts are here
to stay, offering the only solution that can realize the full potential of
digital value in crypto. With Kadenaswap bringing the first multi-protocol DEX
to production, platform interoperation with Pact, more exchanges and wallets,
and paradigm-shifting NFT projects, Q2 will continue Kadena’s march to the
future!
