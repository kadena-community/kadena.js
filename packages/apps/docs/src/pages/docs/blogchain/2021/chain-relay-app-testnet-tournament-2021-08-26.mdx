## Chain Relay App: Testnet Tournament

With the testnet launch of Kadena’s Chain Relay App, we’re kicking off a Testnet
Tournament to see who can redeem the most testnet KDA (tKDA) from running the
relay app! With the potential to earn over **10,000 KDA**, read this quick
article on the objectives and rules of this tournament to increase your chances
of earning the most KDA!

## Objective

Participants must compete to **accumulate the most relay fees **for their
testnet KDA (tKDA) account(s).

## Rewards

Participants with the most fees win, with potential rewards of over **10,000
KDA**! The more tKDA you accumulate over your competitors, the higher your
reward will be!

## Contest Duration

The contest will be held for **14 days**, starting on August 25, 2021, till
September 8, 2021.

## Bond Parameters

Here is a list of parameters for the testnet bonds:

- Bond Amount: **20 tKDA**

- Lockup: **10 days**

- Daily Risk Fee Percentage: **50% **(100 tKDA for the lockup period)

- Activity Fee: **40 tKDA per endorsement**

- Minimum Activity: **10 **(minimum to earn risk fee AND tournament rewards)

- Total reward pool: **15,000 KDA**

- Endorser minimum: **10**

- Confirmation: **0.5**

## Rules

**1. Bonds must be created, and all tKDA rewards collected, during the test
period.**

- This \*\*\*\*means that only 1 period of 10 days will apply and participants
  must renew in the 14 day period.

**2. tKDA accounts that fund bonds must have the same account ID as an active
KDA account in mainnet to receive rewards.**

- Thus if you create testnet tKDA bonds from a Zelcore-created account, you must
  also have that same Zelcore account ID in mainnet, which will receive the
  rewards. We recommend creating dedicated mainnet and testnet accounts for the
  purposes of the tournament.

**3. All participants that achieve the activity minimum will receive a minimum
reward.**

- For up to 10 participants, the minimum reward is the minimum activity + risk
  fee: 500 KDA.

- For greater than 10 participants, a pool of 5000 KDA will be divided by the
  participant count, thus with 15 participants, the minimum reward will be
  333.33 KDA.

**4. Leaders earn up to the remaining pool (total pool — minimum rewards)
divided by their percentage lead over minimum earnings.**

- Thus if 2 leading participants tied with 14 activity/day, while 8 others did
  the minimum, they would each win 5,500 KDA while the other participants would
  win 500 KDA.

- However if the 2 leading participants only did 4 activity/day, their reward
  would be their actual tKDA earnings of 1,700.

- The maximum individual reward with full participation is 10,500 KDA.

- Maximum total payouts will not exceed **15,000 KDA**.

**5. Participants may not modify the relay app software in any way.**

- If the record on the blockchain shows that a participant altered the relay app
  software, for instance, to propose headers sooner than the time determined by
  the software, they will not be eligible for rewards in KDA.

**6. Participants must install and use the latest release of the relay app.**

- If this effort results in critical bug fixes, it is important that
  participants use the latest release to ensure we’re testing the software for
  production use.

**7. Participants not meeting the minimum activity requirement will not be
rewarded.**

- Thus if a participant only endorses 9 times, this will not meet the minimum
  activity of 10 endorsements over the period, not receive the risk fee in tKDA,
  and will not be eligible for any reward in KDA.
