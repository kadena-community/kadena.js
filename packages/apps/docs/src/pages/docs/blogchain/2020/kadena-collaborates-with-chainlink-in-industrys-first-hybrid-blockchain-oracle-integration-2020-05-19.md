# Kadena Collaborates with Chainlink in Industry’s First Hybrid Blockchain Oracle Integration

_Scalable layer-1 PoW public network, developed by former JP Morgan blockchain
team, will deploy Chainlink’s oracles for tamper-proof on-chain data feeds_

Chainlink and Kadena are working together to integrate Chainlink’s
market-leading decentralized oracle network to Kadena’s scalable layer-1 Proof
of Work public blockchain. This will be an industry first in deploying oracles
to a public/private hybrid blockchain platform. Enterprises and entrepreneurs in
the Kadena ecosystem can utilize Chainlink oracles to create end-to-end Pact
smart contracts using Chainlink’s large collection of pre-made inputs and
outputs. Kadena developers can benefit from Chainlink’s high-quality data by
building [Price Reference Contracts](https://feeds.chain.link/) for market
prices and leveraging its external adapter technology for off-chain access to
credentialed APIs and legacy systems. Chainlink also provides strong security
and reliability guarantees via decentralization, wherein multiple independent
oracles and data sources can be aggregated together to protect against any
single point of failure or a sole arbiter of truth.

Having completed its mainnet launch at the start of 2020, Kadena is eager to
make Chainlink oracles available to production-ready smart contracts. All
parties involved will feel a greater degree of security and reliability with
smart contract transactions that consume accurate, real-time data feeds.
Chainlink has extensive expertise in developing oracle solutions, as evident by
their ongoing work with technology leaders such as
[Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/building-hybrid-blockchain-cloud-applications-with-ethereum-and-google-cloud),
[Oracle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2019/07/30/oracle-building-a-virtuous-cycle-of-innovation-with-start-ups-through-chainlink-and-blockchain/#34cfc294ffcc),
and
[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/chainlink-reaches-milestone-with-polkadot/).
Kadena previously announced an
[agreement with Web3 Foundation](/docs/blogchain/2019/kadena-to-explore-implementation-of-pact-for-polkadot-ecosystem-2019-11-12)
to examine how its Pact smart contract language can get implemented on Polkadot.
For blockchain technology to go mainstream, it is important that credible
projects commit to cooperating on interoperability between ecosystems.

Kadena has already identified use cases where the live data accuracy of
Chainlink’s oracles will service key functionality for on-chain applications.
The initial implementation will likely be a KDA price oracle feed, available to
dApp developers and exchanges. When Kadena’s KDA token gets a major listing,
currently projected for the second or third quarter of this year, reliable
fiat-denominated price feeds for KDA will become important for enterprises
wanting to pay for gas in traditional currencies. Dependable and instantaneous
market data will also be a requirement for launching many decentralized and
traditional finance applications, such as with Kadena’s ongoing
[collaboration with $3 billion asset manager USCF](/docs/blogchain/2019/uscf-collaborates-with-kadena-on-use-of-blockchain-in-the-investment-space-2019-05-13).
Furthermore, Kadena can provide a critical tool for addressing the COVID-19
pandemic by using Chainlink oracles to validate coronavirus testing kits and
test results. Over time, Kadena and Chainlink look forward to sharing additional
information about the industry’s first integration of leading oracles with a
hybrid blockchain.

“Terminals provide an essential service in asset management with real-time
market data. As USCF works with Kadena to identify opportunities to leverage
blockchain for investments, we see merit in having credible oracles provide
consolidated data feeds on-chain. Kadena’s latest news is another step forward
in showing the full value of hybrid blockchain,” said Nicholas Gerber, CEO of
Concierge, USCF’s parent company.

Chainlink’s highly reliable network of independent and verified node operators
will perform decentralized computations to improve the accuracy of external data
before being committed to the blockchain. Kadena will leverage its scalability
and low gas fees to increase the frequency and accuracy of external data
available on the network, thus creating a cost-efficient and high-quality
platform for DeFi and other decentralized applications.

“We’re excited to augment the value created through Kadena’s unique hybrid
blockchain by bringing secure and reliable data feeds on-chain via Chainlink
decentralized oracle networks. With this access to high-quality credential API
data via Chainlink oracles, the Kadena ecosystem can begin developing
next-generation smart contracts that depend on real-world data,” said Sergey
Nazarov, Chainlink Co-Founder.

“When Sergey and I met to talk through the integration between Chainlink and
Kadena, we were both immediately excited about what we can accomplish together,”
said Stuart Popejoy, Kadena Co-Founder. “Kadena’s Pact smart contract language
is becoming the standard with its powerful features such as allowing for
multi-sig transactions and formal verification. Combined with the Kadena public
blockchain’s scalability, throughput, and low gas costs, we’re enabling
high-quality financial market data in a way previously unseen on crypto
platforms. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network adds further security and
value to developing and executing smart contracts.”
