description:
  Kadena has successfully launched the first sharded layer-1 PoW public
  blockchain. Since the launch in January, the team has been concentrating on
  the growth and stability of the public network. At the end of March, the
  Kadena public blockchain grew to a hash rate above 100 Terahashes per second
  (that’s 100 trillion hashes), completed over 75,000 successful token
  transfers, and mined more than 4 million blocks.

# Kadena Roadmap for Q3 2020

Following the first official listing of the
[KDA token on Bittrex Global](https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-KDA),
Kadena is sharing our Q3 roadmap below. Already in July, Head of Research and
Networks Monica Quaintance participated in a
[live AMA on Chainlink’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbeJXGiITt4)
channel, where she provided an update on the collaboration between the two
teams. Monica explained how the projects add value to one another by saying,
“Kadena is like a giant brain, and having Chainlink oracles is basically like
giving your brain sensory input.” On testnet, Kadena has scaled from 10 to 20
chains.

For reference, here is an updated version of Kadena’s roadmap for the first half
of this year. While we moved an update on the Polkadot collaboration to Q3 (they
have understandably been busy with their recent launch), the Kadena team
achieved all of our other milestones on time.

During the third quarter of 2020, there will be a significant advancement in
Kadena’s blockchain technology as we scale the sharded layer-1 blockchain from
10 to 20 chains in production (mainnet). We look forward to announcing a new
DeFi partnership in addition to providing updates on our current collaborations
with Polkadot and USCF. Community efforts will continue receiving investment as
we explore multiple simultaneous algorithms for miners and introduce a developer
engagement program. The developer program will enhance the ease of onboarding to
build on our blockchain platform using the Turing-incomplete
[Pact smart contract language](https://pactlang.org).

By the close of Q3, Kadena will complete implementation with the Rosetta
protocol launched by Coinbase. We believe that Kadena will be the first sharded
multichain network to fully integrate with the API, which has been designed to
standardize the process of
[bringing a blockchain project’s data to Coinbase](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-open-sources-technical-standard-to-streamline-token-listings)
and other exchanges.

Thank you to our community members for all of the comments, questions, and
suggestions, including the feedback shared during Discord and Telegram AMAs.
