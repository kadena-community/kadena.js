# Announcing Kadena Technical Grants

Kadena has launched Technical Grants, a structured model designed to reward
blockchain developers for contributing their talent to the world’s fastest
layer-1 PoW network.

## Empowered Innovation

The goal of Technical Grants is to accelerate the growth of the Kadena ecosystem
by funding software development that provides novel use cases and user-friendly
tooling.

It takes a thriving and diverse community to deliver the pipeline of solutions
necessary to realize the full potential of this emerging digital economy. We
believe Kadena’s hybrid blockchain provides the best framework. If you share
this vision, we encourage you to apply for grant funding.
