## Kadena Roadmap for Q1-Q2 2020

**Kadena has successfully launched the first sharded layer-1 PoW public
blockchain.**

Since the launch in January, the team has been concentrating on the growth and
stability of the public network. At the end of March, the Kadena public
blockchain grew to a hash rate above 100 Terahashes per second (that’s 100
trillion hashes), completed over 75,000 successful token transfers, and mined
more than 4 million blocks.

For the second quarter of 2020, we’re looking forward to sharing updates on our
collaboration projects with other leading next-generation networks Cosmos and
Polkadot. Kadena is currently on track to complete
[Kadenamint](https://medium.com/kadena-io/introducing-kadenamint-and-chainweb-testnet-v2-cde077c02ebc),
the integration of our wallet+IDE
[Chainweaver](https://www.kadena.io/chainweaver) and the Pact smart contract
language with the Cosmos ecosystem. Listing the KDA token on a top-tier
cryptocurrency exchange is also a target for Q2. In addition, we’re releasing a
simple demo app to showcase the utility of Kadena’s hybrid blockchain platform.
Finally, we’re making updates to the
[Kadena Block Explorer](https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet) so that users can
look up specific transactions and receive confirmation of coin transfers.

Like many projects, the Kadena team has a decentralized structure to facilitate
remote work, which allows us to keep advancing our technology during the current
pandemic. We hope you are staying safe. We’re glad to collaborate with
organizations seeking to address COVID-19 using blockchain. To contact us, send
a message on Discord (link at bottom).

Thank you to the community, including miners and partners, for engaging with our
team on Discord to provide ideas for improving the ecosystem.
