# Kadena Roadmap for Q4 2020

As announced last month, creating the
[multi-protocol Kadenaswap DEX](https://medium.com/kadena-io/kadena-embraces-defi-with-multi-protocol-decentralized-exchange-kadenaswap-eee862e80212)
is the primary focus for Kadena’s blockchain engineers for the rest of the year
and going forward through 2021. Of course, the team will also be working on
additional efforts to benefit the ecosystem and community. Some of the
activities we’ve already completed in October include Co-founder and CEO Will
Martino speaking at LA Blockchain Summit and the Zel project partnering with us
for node incentivization on the Flux platform. In addition, Kadena’s sharded and
scalable layer-1 blockchain has crossed the milestones of having a 1 million
block height along with 11 million blocks mined.

As shown here, the Kadena team continues to strengthen our industry reputation
for delivering on time and as promised.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we will announce a new DeFi partnership for
Kadenaswap. The new partner will add further value to the DEX, which will
support multiple protocols such as Ethereum, Celo, Maker, Polkadot, Cosmos,
Chainlink, and Bitcoin. Building upon the
[developer program](https://www.kadena.io/developers) that formally kicked off
last quarter, Kadena will offer a grant program to application developers and
share an update on a KDA ASIC that will be available to miners for purchase.

Before the end of the year, Kadenaswap and decentralized bridges will get
launched in testnet. Alongside the technical achievement, Kadena plans to
provide an update on our ongoing exploration of a KDAX governance token. We
welcome your input on both Kadenaswap and KDAX as we are motivated to contribute
to DeFi in meaningful ways.

Thank you to the Kadena community for your constructive comments, questions, and
suggestions, including the feedback shared during our regular Discord and
Telegram AMAs.
