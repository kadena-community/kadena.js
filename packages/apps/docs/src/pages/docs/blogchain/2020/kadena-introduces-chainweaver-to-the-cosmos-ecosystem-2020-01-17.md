## Kadena Introduces Chainweaver to the Cosmos Ecosystem

_Kadena follows the release of Kadenamint with an interoperable digital wallet_

[Kadena](https://www.kadena.io/), the first blockchain technology company to
come out of JP Morgan’s Blockchain Center for Excellence, announced the
integration of its digital wallet Chainweaver onto the
[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) network. Chainweaver is a multi-blockchain
interoperable wallet that also functions as a development environment for smart
contracts. Cosmos, currently valued at an over $850 million market cap, made
headlines earlier this year when it launched the Cosmos Hub, designed to be a
point of interaction and interoperability for many different blockchains. The
integration of Chainweaver onto the Cosmos ecosystem is expected to be completed
by the end of Q1.

The rapid development of many different blockchains over the past two years has
flooded the industry with a variety of options for blockchain transactions,
including transferring cryptocurrencies and running applications. Blockchain
transactions take place through a medium known as “smart contracts.” Cosmos
allows blockchains to interoperate with one another, reducing the friction for
participants in the overall blockchain ecosystem.

Kadena’s Chainweaver wallet is a multi-chain interoperable wallet that stores
cryptocurrency and is also a development environment that makes creating usable
applications on Cosmos and Kadena both faster and safer. Chainweaver supports
development in the Pact smart contract language, which is available in the
Cosmos ecosystem as Kadenamint. With Chainweaver, developers can write smart
contracts for both Cosmos and Kadena from the same interface, giving developers
access to market-leading features such as Formal Verification and
Capabilities-based security.

“Blockchains help solve large-scale issues like scalability, security, and
usability in the multi-stakeholder environments of practically any industry,”
said Interchain Foundation Technical Director \*\*\*\*Ethan Buchman. “We’re
working with Kadena to integrate their digital wallet Chainweaver into the
larger Cosmos ecosystem to tackle these issues like never before, enabling users
to build Pact smart contracts running on the Tendermint consensus engine through
Chainweaver’s stellar UX.”

Previously, applications for a blockchain needed to be developed in the language
native to that chain, e.g. Solidity for Etherum or Pact for Kadena. With the
introduction of Kadenamint — Pact on Cosmos — and Chainweaver, for the first
time a developer can create a single application that is compatible with
multiple worlds, all inside of the same piece of software. This flexibility
reduces friction to deployment and allows creators to rapidly release new
products in more markets.

“The implementation of Chainweaver onto the Cosmos network enables participants
to build on a blockchain more easily than ever before,” said Kadena Founder and
CEO Will Martino. “Kadenamint was the first step in achieving this, giving users
a smart contract language they could trust to provide both functionality and
security. Chainweaver amplifies that ability by presenting a digital wallet that
can support the industry’s big-picture goals of an interoperable financial
ecosystem.”

**About Kadena**

Kadena provides the only public blockchain that is production-ready for smart
contracts, solving the scaling challenges of Bitcoin and the security issues of
Ethereum. Kadena’s founders created JP Morgan’s first blockchain and worked at
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The team is the first to bring
together engineers with decades of banking, commerce, and regulatory experience
to a public blockchain. Kadena is in use with businesses including USCF (a $3
billion fund) and Rymedi (tracking the quality of medicinal products). For more

**About Cosmos**

The Cosmos Network is a decentralized network of independent parallel
blockchains developed by California-based startup Tendermint Inc. With Cosmos,
blockchains can maintain sovereignty, process transactions quickly, and
communicate with other blockchains in the ecosystem. This is achieved through a
set of open-source tools like Tendermint, the Cosmos SDK, and IBC, which were
designed to let people build custom, secure, scalable, and interoperable
blockchain applications quickly. For more information, visit
