# Polkadot Collaboration Update: Researching Pact Core for WASM and Exploring KadenaDOT

As one of our commitments on the Q3 roadmap, we’re providing an update on
Kadena’s collaboration with Web3 Foundation to explore the implementation of our
technology with Polkadot.

As part of our ongoing work with the Polkadot team, our lead language engineer
Emily Pillmore developed an exciting long-term approach to extend the benefits
of Pact to the Polkadot community while also furthering Pact as the standard for
smart contracts: Pact Core. With Pact Core, Polkadot or any WASM-compatible
platform can natively execute Pact smart contract code with the help of a
minimal interpreter installed directly on-chain.

Toward this end, Kadena and Polkadot agree that the best path forward for Pact
Core is to open an RFC (Request for Comment) where community members can
participate in the design process. We’ve kicked off the public discussion
[here](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/pull/8).

**KadenaDOT: A Potential Near-Term Bridge to Polkadot**

As an alternative to Pact Core, and a potentially faster integration with
Polkadot, Kadena’s permissioned blockchain technology Kuro can be adapted to
operate as a Polkadot _parachain_ in a design called KadenaDOT. (Parachains are
the term that Polkadot uses to describe an external system, like a blockchain,
that forms a constituent member of their ecosystem.) Kuro is an evolution of
J.P. Morgan’s Juno blockchain which was successfully deployed internally for the
first generation of JPMCoin by Kadena’s founders. Kuro is one of the fastest
enterprise-grade blockchains ever created with the built-in capacity to run Pact
smart contracts.

KadenaDOT acts as a bridge technology between the Polkadot and Kadena
ecosystems, offering the power of Pact smart contracts to parachain operators,
while the Core Pact RFC will bring about the final goal of running Pact anywhere
in the entire Polkadot network.

**Request for Community Feedback**

Enterprise blockchains that are a “real blockchain,” and not something
[masquerading as a blockchain like IBM’s Hyperledger](https://thenextweb.com/podium/2019/05/05/ibms-hyperledger-isnt-a-real-blockchain-heres-why)
or R3’s
[Corda technology](https://www.ccn.com/r3-corda-is-not-a-blockchain-and-we-didnt-say-it-was-as-critics-take-aim),
are quite rare. Real permissioned networks have all the features of a blockchain
(e.g. hardened consensus, simple operation) needed for a killer layer-2 solution
_and_ they are battle-tested by some of the largest companies in the world.

[As a “real” permissioned blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/evolution-kadena-first-real-private-blockchain),
Kuro is an excellent candidate for a parachain. KadenaDOT would be a major
strategic pivot for Kuro. To help us prioritize, we want to hear your opinions
on the idea of bringing KadenaDOT to market _before_ Pact Core.

Would you use KadenaDOT? Do you think more parachains are important to Polkadot
and/or to DeFi as a whole? Do you think the best way forward is using
permissioned layer-2 blockchains as bridges between ecosystems?
