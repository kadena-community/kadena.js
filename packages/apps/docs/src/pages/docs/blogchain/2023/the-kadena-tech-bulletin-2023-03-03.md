# The Kadena Tech Bulletin #1 — March 3, 2023

Welcome to Kadena’s very first inaugural issue of The Kadena Tech Bulletin!

Whether you’re already familiar with Kadena or just learning about it for the
first time, the Kadena Tech Bulletin provides a short technical overview of how
we are revolutionizing the industry one block at a time. From Pact and Chainweb
to how we are refining our builder onboarding process, we’ll be providing our
community of builders and developers with all the updates and tools to help grow
and scale the entire ecosystem.
