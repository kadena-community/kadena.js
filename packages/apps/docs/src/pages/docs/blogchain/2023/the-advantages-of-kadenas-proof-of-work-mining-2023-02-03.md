Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm used in blockchain technology to
validate transactions and produce new blocks. In PoW mining, “miners” compete to
solve hard mathematical problems, and the first to solve a problem adds a new
block to the chain and is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. The use of
computing power and energy consumption ensures security by preventing
centralization as well as the risk of fraud. When no user can attempt to spend
the same digital token twice, the integrity of the system remains intact.

### Kadena’s scalable Proof of Work and How it is energy efficient

The design of Kadena’s scalable PoW consensus algorithm is more efficient and
secure compared to traditional PoW-only systems, making it a “greener”
alternative for crypto mining.

Kadena’s unique multi-chain architecture makes it the only platform that can
deliver increased energy efficiency as transaction volume scales. With 20 chains
live, Kadena’s current network capacity sits at 600 transactions per second
(TPS), nearly achieving the energy efficiency of Visa. When the network
approaches the need for a higher transaction volume due to increased usage, the
network will increase the number of chains again to handle the load. This allows
the network to process more transactions per second than a single-chain system
such as Bitcoin.

Perhaps most significantly, scaling Kadena does not require more miners to join
the network. At 20 chains and 600 TPS, Kadena’s throughput is 100x that of BTC
and there are no compromises to either security or decentralization. As network
demand increases, Kadena’s energy use remains constant.

### The Future of Sustainable Kadena Mining

Having 20 blocks every ~30 seconds minimizes Kadena’s energy cost per
transaction, establishing it as one of the lowest in the industry. Kadena
strives to carbon footprint in PoW for its community of miners.

Finally, and perhaps most excitingly, Kadena Eco will announce its second cohort
of grantees very soon, wherein one of the grantees will be paving the way for a
greener future for PoW mining on Kadena.
