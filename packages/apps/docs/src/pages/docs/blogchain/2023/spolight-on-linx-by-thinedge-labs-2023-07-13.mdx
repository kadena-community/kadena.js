Welcome to the Kadena Project Spotlight Series, where we highlight the
groundbreaking work of organizations currently building and innovating on the
[Kadena](http://kadena.io) blockchain!

Today, we’re shining the spotlight on **[**Linx](https://linxwallet.xyz/), the
first chain-less wallet building on Kadena. Linx is a revolutionary crypto
wallet designed specifically for operating on the Kadena blockchain. With a
vision to provide users with an intuitive and hassle-free experience, Linx
strives to eliminate the complexities often associated with Web3 technologies.
Simplicity and efficiency are important to Linx, which is why their wallet
empowers users to accomplish their tasks with just a few taps, without the need
for extensive technical knowledge. Say goodbye to the hurdles of the past and
embrace a new era of user-centric crypto wallets with Linx.

To gain a better understanding of Linx’s innovative approach, let’s break down
some key questions:

### What is a chain-less wallet?

Kadena blockchain operates on a multi-chain architecture, which can often be
complex and daunting for users to understand and navigate. However, with Linx,
this complexity is abstracted away, allowing users to enjoy a simplified and
streamlined experience. Instead, they can focus on effortlessly accessing and
navigating the Kadena ecosystem without the burden of technical intricacies.
This ultimately drives adoption and enhances the overall crypto experience.

### What sets Linx apart from other smart wallets?

1.  **Gas-Free:** One of the notable advantages of using Linx is the ability to
    enjoy gas-free transfers and swaps. Traditionally, users need to pay
    transaction fees or gas to complete transactions on blockchain networks.
    However, Linx removes this barrier by offering gas-free transfers, allowing
    users to send and receive funds without worrying about additional costs. In
    fact, Linx is the first wallet in the world to enable a gas-free experience
    in the crypto space.

2.  **Chain-less approach:** Linx offers a chain-less experience, allowing users
    to easily interact with the Kadena blockchain without the need to understand
    its underlying multi-chain structure.

3.  **Built-in DEX aggregator**: Linx incorporates a built-in DEX (Decentralized
    Exchange) aggregator, enabling users to access multiple decentralized
    exchanges from a single platform. This simplifies the process of trading and
    swapping tokens as users find the best possible prices and execute trades
    efficiently by aggregating liquidity across various DEXs.

4.  **Security and Privacy:** Linx places utmost importance on security and
    privacy. By maintaining a strong commitment to security best practices, Linx
    ensures that users’ funds are protected. Simply put, your private keys are
    encrypted and never leave your device.

### What can we expect from Linx in 6 months? In 1 year?

Here’s what you can expect from Linx Wallet in the near future:

1.  **Reward System:\*** \*Linx is actively developing a reward system within
    the wallet, providing users the ability to earn Linx tokens as they engage
    with the platform. This incentivizes user participation and provides
    additional value to the community.

2.  **Multi-Sig Support\***:\* Linx is working on integrating multi-signature
    (multi-sig) support, which enhances security by requiring multiple
    authorized parties to approve transactions.

3.  **DApp Integration:** With the ease of incorporating popular DApps into the
    wallet, users gain convenient and direct access to their favorite
    decentralized applications

4.  **Desktop Wallet\***: \*Recognizing the importance of catering to different
    user preferences and needs, Linx also has a desktop version on their
    roadmap.

### Will Linx have an IDO for Linx Token?

No, Linx tokens can only be earned by using the wallet. When Linx is launched,
users will have the opportunity to earn and mint certificates, which can later
be exchanged for Linx tokens. There will be limited certificates available for
activities such as installing the app, sharing on social media, and swapping
tokens.

### Are there fees inside Linx?

For transfers, there are zero fees, and Linx covers gas. However, swaps incur a
0.7% fee.

### What attracted Linx to Kadena? What has it been like building on Kadena?

Linx has been in the ecosystem since early 2020, and the attraction to Kadena
was its distinctive approach to blockchain architecture and the remarkable Pact
smart contract language. Kadena’s multi-chain architecture, with its focus on
scalability, speed, and security, stood out as a forward-thinking solution for
the challenges faced by traditional blockchain networks.

Learning and coding in [Pact ](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact)has been an
absolute blast, providing a refreshing experience compared to other smart
contract languages. Once they became comfortable with Pact and its concepts,
they found it to be incredibly enjoyable and efficient in transforming their
ideas into reality.

Many thanks to Linx for sharing their vision of what a decentralized oracle
future will look like. We’ll be featuring more Project Spotlights in the coming
weeks, so stay tuned as we’ll continue to profile innovative organizations that
are currently building on Kadena.
