### 4. Language Server Protocol

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a protocol developed by Microsoft to
standardize the communication between development tools, such as the editors and
IDEs. By leveraging the LSP, Kadena provides a better user experience and
increased support for the development of secure contracts within the developer’s
preferred integrated development environment.

### 5. Kadena Academy Workshop

A few weeks ago, we hosted our very first Kadena Academy workshop, Getting
Started with KadenaJs, with Davy Engone. If you missed this workshop, be sure to
stay connected with us through our social media channels for updates on our
upcoming workshops!

In the coming weeks, the Kadena team will be focusing on the release of a
much-anticipated update for Chainweb and dedicating their efforts towards
bringing Pact to Web2.

As Kadena continues to push the boundaries of innovation and continues to
evolve, we look forward to providing builders with regular Tech Bulletins so
that you can continue to develop with the latest cutting edge technology. Be

updates from the Kadena Team!
