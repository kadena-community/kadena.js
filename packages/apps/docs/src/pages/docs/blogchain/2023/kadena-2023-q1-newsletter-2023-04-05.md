  Decentralized finance (DeFi) emerged as a standout application of blockchain
  technology in late 2017 and broke into the mainstream in 2020. Decentralized
  finance represents a vision of a financial system that operates without
  intermediaries such as banks and other third-party entities. It instead relies
  on the power of smart contracts to facilitate transactions.

## Kadena 2023 Q1 Newsletter

![](/assets/blog/1_vA09z1Z28bu459OOK2H5iA.webp)

## Welcome to the first edition of Kadena’s 2023 quarterly newsletter!

2023 started off with a bang — there’s been so much that has happened,
everything from Pact updates, Kadena grantee announcements, and community
initiatives.

Kadena invites our community to take a closer look at everything we have done in
the last few months as we continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in
the blockchain industry.

## On-Chain Activity: Onwards and Upwards!

Our hashrate has boomed over the last few months due to
[Bitmain](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=000202302201612117066S2KG11605C9)
shipping a new batch of their KA3 miner.
[Kadena Mining Club](https://kdamining.club/) also recently launched their
hashrate-backed NFTs, making it easier than ever to get in on the mining action
without having to even own a miner. This rapid increase in hashrate will
continue to improve Kadena’s security and decentralization by adding new mining
pools, like our first decentralized mining pool,
[NoPool.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kadena-grant-recipient-massive-to-launch-nopool-a-decentralized-carbon-neutral-proof-of-work-mining-pool-301751569.html)

Furthermore, Kadena’s monthly transaction counts have **increased approximately
45%** from the beginning of the year, and **increased 166.84% from March 2022**,
signifying a dramatic increase in user and project participation in our
ecosystem. With more developer tooling and resources soon to come, we anticipate
an influx of projects building innovative dApps.

## Innovation around the Block: Grantee Updates

![]/assets/blog/1_FgpEZ1GkZa_OMAipYo4bAQ.webp)

Q1 saw the rollout of the first two of our 2nd cohort grantees, with both
projects exhibiting innovative potential to revolutionize the industry. They
are:

1.  [NoPool](https://twitter.com/nopoolparty), powered by
    [Massive](https://www.joinmassive.com/), is a Kadena-first, Stratum crypto
    mining pool that is taking the green mining initiative to the next level.
    NoPool ensures no centralization, no emission footprint or conventional fees
    for low-emission miners, and no performance compromise. What is remarkable
    about NoPool is that it is not only eco-friendly, it is **_the first
    decentralized mining pool in history_**! Even more exciting is that NoPool
    has received support from the world’s leading manufacturer of crypto miners,
    Bitmain. Learn more about
    [NoPool ](https://medium.com/kadena-io/project-spotlight-nopool-powered-by-massive-2f8d220bd34)here.

2.  [Tellor](https://tellor.io/) is a decentralized oracle protocol that allows
    smart contracts to trustlessly receive external data. Tellor is working with
    Kadena to develop an oracle service to support DeFi infrastructure on the
    Kadena blockchain, such as bridges to other networks like Ethereum. They
    have already completed the development of their oracle protocol on testnet.
    You can view the Pact code
    [here](https://github.com/tellor-io/Tellorflex-kadena.).

We’re pleased to have a roster of other amazing new grantees in the pipeline and
are extremely excited to see the groundbreaking impact that these projects will
have in the blockchain space in the future.

Meanwhile, our other grantees have also been busy innovating in the Kadena
ecosystem:

1.  [Koala Wallet](https://koalawallet.io/) has been diligently adding updates,
    including the recently launched in-app NFT support. Currently, the team is
    putting in tremendous efforts to release the new KDA block explorer, which
    will feature a redesigned interface and a lightning-fast indexer to offer
    users a seamless experience.

2.  [Hypercent](https://app.hypercent.io/) recently launched an NFT marketplace
    on the Kadena blockchain, and we expect to see an influx of art and NFT
    projects on the Kadena blockchain soon.

3.  [Crankk](https://crankk.io/) has begun the rollout of their
    [BETA launch](https://alviso.medium.com/announcement-for-the-upcoming-beta-launch-d1c3e11db06a),
    offering licenses for Crankk and Helium miners to secure Crankk nodes.

As always, Kadena is committed to supporting our grantees to help them achieve
their goals, and help projects grow within the broader Kadena ecosystem.

Stay tuned for updates on the progress of our grantees!

## Surging Forward: Tech Developments and Upgrades

![](/assets/blog/1_7wGO0X8eHyMFfYUAxYn0tg.webp)

To say that it was a busy quarter for our engineers and developers at Kadena
would be an understatement. Here’s a quick snapshot of all that Kadena’s tech
team has accomplished over the first quarter of 2023:

At the beginning of the year, we released Marmalade’s
[token policies tutorial](./nft-collection-tutorial-on-marmalade-2023-01-25)
demonstrating how an NFT collection supporting presale could be implemented in
your NFT marketplace.
[Chainweaver Wallet 2.2.3](https://medium.com/kadena-io/chainweaver-2-2-3-improving-user-experience-with-quicksign-support-49bedb9e963d)
was then released, which allows for quicksign support for desktop applications
along with various bug fixes, taking user experience to the next level.

[Pact 4.6](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/releases/tag/v4.6.0), which
provides several new built-in functions, was released in mid-Q1, shortly
followed by a Chainweb 2.18 release that included a new /local endpoint,
preflight simulation API, new ZK native function support, better gas estimation,
bug fixes, and more.

As the year progresses, there will be some really exciting developments, for
Pact and for the Kadena ecosystem as a whole… for a preview, tune in to this

Campfire with our CEO Stuart Popejoy where he spills the tea!

## Keeping Busy: Community, Marketing, Events, and more

![](/assets/blog/1_FrQ7He8MuTE8WH35zFGXRw.webp)

You asked and we delivered! The community has been requesting increased
engagement and interaction from the team at Kadena, so we’ve buckled down and
incorporated a few new exciting changes.

We now have **Kadena Community Campfires**, a weekly community call on
Wednesdays hosted by our tech adoption lead, Tyler Benster. The Campfire
features different special guests each week to provide the latest crypto updates
and answer our communities’ most pressing and interesting questions. Tune in
every Wednesday at 12 pm ET / 9 am ET via our
[Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6-MaxD2hlcGLL70ukHotA)!

We’ve also incorporated our exclusive
[\*\*Builder Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fmghCiHZxQ)\*\* to provide
our community of builders and developers with insightful conversations with our
tech team. Our Builders Strategies Call happens every six weeks and includes
updates on the latest Kadena developments as well as feedback and suggestions to
help our builders take their projects to the next level. Apply
[here](https://khnrs3ltkjv.typeform.com/to/X0Jxs9bD?typeform-source=t.co) to be
part of the next call!

The Kadena team has also been making appearances outside of the digital realm.
At [JSWorld](https://twitter.com/Randynamic_4/status/1623260270100463620) in
Amsterdam, the Kadena.js team wowed attendees with their presentation on the
Pact smart contract language.

Our COO, Anastasia Bez, and Kadena ECO CEO, Francesco Melpignano, joined our
business development team in attending
[EthDenver](https://twitter.com/kadena_io/status/1638906216293474304) where they
forged valuable connections and collaborated with local Denver hotspot, the
Banshee House, to host an unforgettable night.

Topping off a hectic week, Anastasia’s presence in a
[Bloomberg interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmndhqyh7gw) with Ed
Ludlow and Caroline Hyde was a major accomplishment for our team. Discussion was
focused on the critical need for crypto firms to build effective infrastructure
and technical support systems.

We are thrilled to share that the Kadena team will be participating in Consensus
this coming April in Austin. Keep an eye out for us; we look forward to meeting
some of you soon!
