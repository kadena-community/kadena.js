### Welcome to Kadena’s 2nd issue of The Kadena Tech Bulletin!

Whether you’re already familiar with Kadena or just learning about it for the
first time, the Kadena Tech Bulletin provides a short technical overview of how
we are revolutionizing the blockchain industry one block at a time. From Pact to
Chainweb to how we are refining our builder onboarding process, we’ll be
providing our community of builders and developers with all the updates and
tools to help grow and scale their projects in our ever-growing ecosystem.

Here’s what happened over the last month:

### 1. Wallet Connect Specification

We’ve recently merged our WalletConnect KIP-17, which defines our standard for
interacting with the WalletConnect signing API. This merge allows our entire
ecosystem to take user experience on their dApps to the next level.

**Official release on Github**:

### 2. Charkha Lending Protocol

Inspired by Compound Finance, Thomas Honeyman created the Charkha Lending
Protocol, a complete decentralized lending app built on Kadena’s Chainweb
blockchain. Charkha is a fully-functioning lending protocol with a corresponding
frontend that allows users to run the app, lend funds, submit governance
proposals, and earn interest.

**Full Repo**:

### 3. Kadena Learning Platform

The Kadena Academy provides builders and developers with guidance and tutorials
on how to build and deploy applications on Kadena. We recently sent out the
first 40 invites to those who will get early access to our Learning Platform. We
are excited to receive feedback from our community that will help us improve the
platform and ensure a smooth release for the entire community!
