  The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a buzzword in the technology industry
  in recent years. It refers to the interconnected network of devices, sensors,
  and systems that are able to communicate with each other, collect and share
  data, and perform automated actions without human intervention. This
  technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare

![](/assets/blog/1_2SE_f06Kj-A0xvlHr0XKIg.webp)

Welcome to the 4th issue of The Kadena Tech Bulletin!

Whether you’re already familiar with Kadena or just learning about it for the
first time, the Kadena Tech Bulletin provides a short technical overview of how
we are revolutionizing the blockchain industry one block at a time. From Pact to
Chainweb to how we are refining our builder onboarding process, we’ll be
providing our community of builders and developers with all the updates and
tools to help grow and scale their projects in our ever-growing ecosystem.

Here’s what happened over the last month.

### Chainweb 2.19.1

Chainweb 2.19.1 was released at the end of May, and features the following
upgrades:

- Disable user function return value typechecking

- Add typechecking option to tx-sim

Please note that this version supersedes Chainweb 2.19. Be sure to update to
Chainweb 2.19.1 as soon as possible if you haven’t already done so.

### KIP-0019: Future Iteration of the Coin and Fungible Contracts

KIP-0019 proposes several modifications aimed at improving the reliability and
robustness of these contracts, ensuring a more secure platform for the exchange
of tokens on Kadena’s Platform.

The proposed changes of KIP-0019 include but are not limited to the following:

- Removal of the rotate function

- Reorganization of constants and functions

- Introduction of modifications to the verification-related code

We value our community feedback and have established a time limit of
approximately 1.5 months for the KIP process, which will conclude on July 15th
Anywhere on Earth (AoE). We encourage community engagement up to this deadline
to discuss the future direction of our coin and fungible contracts
[here](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/pull/43).
