# Kadena: The Next Generation Blockchain

JANUARY 2018 ROUND UP — Kadena has a lot of exciting news and updates about our
company, its technology, and what’s on the horizon. We want to thank you all so
much for your incredible enthusiasm and support! Here’s what’s gone down in the
past few months:

## Kadena raises $2.25M in first funding round

Kadena co-founders [Will Martino](http://kadena.io/#/team) and
[Stuart Popejoy](http://kadena.io/#/team) announced that we raised $2.25M in our
pre-A financing round. Major investors in the private-placement SAFT round
included Metastable, Kilowatt Capital, Coinfund, and Multicoin Capital. Check
out the
[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/jp-morgan-blockchain-spin-off-raises-2-25-million/)
article that launched a frenzy of interest and
[read our press release](http://kadena.io/docs/KadenaPR-1-31-2018.pdf).

**When’s the next round?**

Soon™!\* We’re so overwhelmed by your enthusiasm and excitement! For next
round, we’re looking to work with firms and individuals that can help us with
growing our community with international connections, telegram, or other
network-building value adds. We believe that Kadena is the next generation of
blockchain platform for scalable applications and getting adoption for that
platform is going to be central to our growth.

(UPDATE 3/8/18: We are busy closing our current strategic SAFT round. We welcome
interested accredited investors to our next round in May!)

\*Truly soon! Sign up for [our newsletter](http://kadena.io/newsletter) to get
the first news on next rounds and the launch of the public network.

## On Chainweb: Kadena’s public blockchain protocol, announced at Stanford BPASE ‘18

We were proud to once again be invited to Stanford University’s Blockchain
Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering (BPASE) Conference 2018, where we
announced [Kadena Public](http://kadena.io/#/public): our massively-parallelized
public blockchain platform.

Check out: the Youtube video of
[Will’s talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OFJOrgRWw) (with slide deck)
explaining Chainweb’s features.

## We’re Hiring!

Those interested should send their resume or CV to
[hiring@kadena.io](mailto:hiring@kadena.io). We’re on the lookout for:

- **Haskell developers**: as a proud all-Haskell shop, we’re always seeking
  talented Haskellers to join our team, building our platform and smart-contract
  language. We’re also happy to meet F#/Scala/OCaml devs (who either dream in
  Haskell or are down with broadening their horizons) with relevant experience
  in distributed systems or language design.

- **Front-end developers** (Vue/React; UI/UX): work with us to build dashboards
  to visualize and manage our 1000-chain Chainweb public blockchain network &
  administer our enterprise blockchain deployments. Also, our website always
  needs help; the main focus will be internal greenfield dashboards and
  visualizations for our various networks.

Yours truly,
