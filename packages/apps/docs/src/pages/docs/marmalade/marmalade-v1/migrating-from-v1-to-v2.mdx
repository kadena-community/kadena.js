# Migrating from v1 to v2

The Marmalade V2 upgrade brings several substantial changes and enhancements to
the platform. The update introduces multiple policies, a policy manager, and
shifts from on-chain manifest to off-chain URI. Additionally, the migration
guide provides instructions for migrating minted tokens from V1 to V2.

1.  **Token Policies**: The update shifts from `kip.token-policy-v1` to
    `kip.token-policy-v2`, allowing multiple policy implementations in contrast
    to V1, where you could only select a single policy when creating tokens.
2.  **Policy Manager**: The policy manager, a new feature in V2, manages
    multiple policies and calls `enforce-**` functions, unlike in V1, where
    these functions were called directly from the policy.
3.  **On-chain manifest to Off-chain URI**: Marmalade V2 requires `uri` in
    tokens, shifting away from on-chain manifests used in V1. This change
    standardises the method of looking up token data, although projects can
    continue using on-chain manifests by adding a policy e.g. the
    `onchain-manifest-policy-v1` to the `policies` field at token creation.
4.  **Migration of minted tokens from V1**: The guide provides instructions for
    migrating tokens minted in V1 using `migration-policy-v1`, which tracks old
    and new token-ids and the amount burnt and minted.

Overall, the migration from V1 to V2 of Marmalade introduces many enhancements
and changes that provide improved functionality and flexibility to the platform.

It's highly recommended to make the upgrade, and you can follow the detailed
instructions in the
[official Github migration guide](https://www.github.com/kadena.io/marmalade/migration).
