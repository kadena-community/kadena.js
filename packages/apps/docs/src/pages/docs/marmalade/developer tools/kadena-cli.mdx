# Kadena CLI

_WIP: combined cli from all current cli's_

The Kadena Command Line Interface, or as we like to call it, KadenaCLI, is like
a faithful sidekick, always ready to assist you in your creative journey within
the kadena universe. From developing applications, troubleshooting issues,
managing keys and transactions, to directly handling Marmalade's operations,
KadenaCLI is the toolbox to assists you.

In essence, the KadenaCLI is not just an addition to Marmalade, but a catalyst
that simplifies your interaction with the platform, making your job easier. It
does so by providing an array of functionalities that cater to diverse needs:

1.  **Key Generation & Transaction Management**: KadenaCLI simplifies key
    generation and assists in constructing transactions across multiple chains
    using transaction templates. It also allows you to derive transactions from
    personalized templates stored in a public GitHub repository, a feature
    tailored for convenience. _(from kda-tool github (andy made a js version of
    this))_
2.  **Transaction Signing**: The interface supports transaction signing using
    both ED25519 key pairs and Chainweaver-compatible HD keys. It integrates
    with the Kadena wallet signing API and allows you to sign transactions using
    your local Chainweaver keys simply by entering your password. _(from
    kda-tool github (andy made a js version of this))_
3.  **Testing & Feedback**: KadenaCLI provides functionalities to test, send,
    and poll results on the blockchain for multiple transactions. It also
    supports basic operations for interacting with nodes, thus providing
    valuable insights for the developers. _(from kda-tool github (andy made a js
    version of this))_
4.  **TypeScript Type Generation**: For those working with Pact Smart Contracts,
    KadenaCLI can create TypeScript types, thereby enhancing productivity and
    operational ease. _(from pactjs-cli by albert)_
5.  **Project Boilerplate Creation**: KadenaCLI supports the creation of new
    boilerplate projects in React, Vue, and Angular, assisting developers in
    initiating projects in their preferred tech stack. _(from create-kadena-app
    by jermaine)_
6.  **Marmalade**: Within Marmalade, KadenaCLI aids in creating, minting and
    managing Marmalade NFT's/collections. Furthermore, it simplifies the process
    of adding policies to collections and listing on marketplaces. _(extend with
    future features)_
