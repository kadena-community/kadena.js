# Developer tools

With the constantly evolving landscape of technology, we understand the
importance of providing robust, versatile tools that empower developers to
innovate. Our goal at Marmalade is not just to provide a powerful NFT standard,
but also to ensure that our community has access to the best toolset that makes
interaction with our platform as seamless as possible.

## Tools

### Kadena CLI

The Kadena Command Line Interface (CLI) currently serves as a crucial tool in
our kit. It has been designed to streamline operations such as key management,
transaction handling, and the execution of Marmalade-specific functions.
