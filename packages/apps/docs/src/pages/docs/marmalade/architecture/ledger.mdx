# The Marmalade Ledger Explained

**What is the Marmalade Ledger?**

What is it and what is it used for. Think of a
[Ledger](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/ledger.pact) as
your personal bank statement, only in this case its not just for you, it's for
everybody participating in the system. It's this big ol' record that keeps track
of the things within marmalade that happen. You can look at the ledger as the
heart of marmalade, the place where most of the action happens.

In the context of NFTs, the Marmalade Ledger plays a crucial role in managing
the lifecycle of these unique digital assets. It provides the underlying
infrastructure and framework necessary to create, transfer, and track ownership
of NFTs within the Marmalade ecosystem. It acts as a decentralised, transparent,
and immutable ledger of ownership, ensuring that every change in ownership,
creation, or transfer of an NFT is securely and accurately recorded.

The ledger consists of several components. It defines tables and schemas to
organise data related to accounts and tokens. It includes capabilities, which
are functions that perform specific actions and enforce certain conditions. By
leveraging the capabilities, tables, and schemas defined within the ledger,
developers and users can interact with NFTs in a standardised and reliable
manner. The ledger enforces policies and guards to ensure compliance with
predefined rules and constraints, promoting secure and trustworthy NFT
transactions.

**Diving Deeper into the Marmalade Ledger**

When delving further into the ledger's workings, we find each function and
capability playing a unique role in its operation and management.

**Capabilities**

There are capabilities like `TRANSFER`, which work similarly to the transfer
feature on your online banking application. They help move tokens between
accounts. There are also capabilities for updates and checks, such as `SUPPLY`,
`TOKEN`, `ACCOUNT_GUARD`, and `RECONCILE`.

Some more specific capabilities include `DEBIT` and `CREDIT`, which gives the
power to use debit or credit functions, and `UPDATE_SUPPLY` allows adjustments
to a token's total circulation.

Capabilities like `MINT` and `BURN` enable creation and removal of tokens
respectively.

**Marketplace related capabilities**

Special marketplace-related capabilities like `SALE`, `OFFER`, `WITHDRAW`, and
`BUY` facilitate the trading of tokens within the marketplace.

**Core functions**

Core functions such as `create-token`, `create-account`, `mint`, `burn`,
`offer`, `withdraw`, `buy`, `transfer`, `get-balance`, `details`,
`total-supply`, and `get-uri` offer a variety of operations from creating new
tokens and accounts to managing token trading in the marketplace.

To sum up, the Marmalade Ledger is a sophisticated system that records and
manages transactions and operation within the Marmalade platform. It ensures
every transaction is accurate, every policy is enforced, and every account is
up-to-date.

We hope you've got a sense of what the marmalade ledger is all about.

Whether you're a code whizz or a crypto newbie, we hope this journey into the
workings of this ledger has helped to unravel some of the mysteries behind it.
