# Leveraging IPFS in Marmalade

Given the immutable characteristic of NFTs, the associated data's long-term
accessibility and sustainability are critical aspects to consider. IPFS has
emerged as a powerful tool to handle these requirements, and its importance is
underscored in the context of Marmalade,

IPFS is a pioneering protocol designed to modernise the internet's foundational
structures, augmenting its capacity for storing, addressing, and accessing data.
This technology is central to our approach in dealing with NFT data, ensuring
its perpetual availability and integrity and thereby strengthening the overall
dependability of the NFTs hosted on Marmalade.

Our guide offers you an easy-to-follow examples for storing your NFT data on
IPFS, aiming to make this process as effortless as possible. These best
practices, which cater to both extensive asset collections and individual NFTs,
are crafted to ensure your data's resilience and longevity in the IPFS
ecosystem.
