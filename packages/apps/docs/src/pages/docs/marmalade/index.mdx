# NFTs on Kadena Marmalade

## What is marmalade (v2)

The long-awaited release of Marmalade’s V2 standard has arrived, bringing a host
of exciting updates and features to the top NFT standard in the industry! If
you’ve been tracking the progress of Kadena and its NFT standards, you know
we’ve been on a journey from the unstandardised on-chain metadata and
single-policy token logic in V1 (KIP-13) to a far more robust and dynamic V2
(KIP-20). We’re thrilled to share the next stage of this adventure.

**Understanding KIP-0020: The Marmalade V2 Standard**

Marmalade V1 initially introduced the use of the Haber manifest model and had a
policy-model token system, allowing tokens to adopt various policies, which adds
extra logic into the marmalade function such as create-token, mint, burn,
transfer, sale. With the V1 model, tokens could be programmed to allow
whitelisted collections, fungible sales with royalties, and more.

Marmalade V2 represents a significant leap forward. It introduces an off-chain
URI with a standardized metadata format, opening the door for marketplaces to
easily fetch necessary data.

In our continuous pursuit of advancement and refinement, we’ve incorporated an
enhanced feature in Marmalade V2: the stacking of policies. Unlike in V1, each
token in V2 isn’t bound by a singular policy. Instead, tokens can accommodate N
number of policies, providing an unprecedented degree of flexibility and
functionality. This feature is powered by one of the most notable additions in
Marmalade V2: “the policy manager”. The policy manager provides token creators
with the convenience of selecting their preferred features from our
comprehensive concrete-policies, enabling effortless token creation. For those
seeking additional rules, policy-list field offers the flexibility to
incorporate specific requirements.

At the heart of this approach, there are two distinct types of policies:
`**concrete-policies**`, and `**custom-policies**`. Let’s dive deeper into what
each of these means:

1.  **Concrete-Policies**: These policies serve as foundational features for the
    token, representing its core characteristics. Stored as boolean values, they
    indicate whether a specific concrete-policy is in use. Importantly, these
    are immutable; once set, they cannot be altered. More importantly, Concrete
    policies are written and maintained by Kadena.

2.  **Custom-Policies**: These policies offer additional functionality, and can
    be provided by 3rd parties. Once established, these policies are also
    immutable, meaning they cannot be changed post-implementation.

With respect to concrete policies, we offer five primary concrete policies which
encapsulate the most commonly used functionalities in token creation. Marmalade
V2 incorporates these concrete policies to simplify the process of token
creation, while simultaneously ensuring that the tokens still benefit from rich,
advanced features. The concrete policies are:

- **Collection Policy**: This policy facilitates the initiation of a collection
  with predefined token lists.

- **Non-fungible Policy**: This policy constrains the token supply to 1 and sets
  precision to 0, thereby enforcing the token’s non-fungibility.

- **Royalty-policy**: Dependent on the `fungible-quote-policy`, this policy
  designates the creator account to receive royalties upon each sale of the
  token using the `fungible-quote-policy`.

- **Guard-policy**: grants the ability to add optional guards to each marmalade
  action.

To incorporate these features during token minting, Marmalade users simply need
to add the policy to the respective `policies` fields at token creation. This
goes for concrete-policies and custom-policies.

**Migration**

For those seeking to migrate from Marmalade V1 to V2, the `migration-policy-v1`
policy is specifically built to migrate `marmalade.ledger` tokens to
`marmalade-v2.ledger`.

For projects that seek to use the v1 manifest model, they can continue using the
manifest using `onchain-manifest-policy-v1`.

The evolution from V1 to V2 signifies our relentless commitment to make NFTs
more secure, flexible, and beneficial for everyone involved — creators, buyers,
and the broader community. While we loved the idea of everyone minting their own
marketplace in V1, we realized that the true strength lies in the policy
management.

As we delve into this new and exciting journey, remember that this is just the
beginning. We’re looking forward to the innovative ways that you, the builders
and pioneers, will harness the power of Marmalade V2 to create a dynamic, more
inclusive, and ever-evolving NFT landscape.
