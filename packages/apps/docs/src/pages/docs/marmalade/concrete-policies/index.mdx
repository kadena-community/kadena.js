# What are concrete-policies

A concrete policy in Marmalade V2 is a pre-built, ready-to-use implementation of
commonly used features in token creation. It simplifies the process of adding
functionality to NFTs and offers convenience for token creators. With concrete
policies, Marmalade aims to provide a rich set of features that can be easily
added to tokens without the need for extensive custom development.

When using a concrete policy, token creators can simply activate a policy by
adding the policy to the respective `policies` fields at token creation. This
goes for concrete-policies and custom-policies. The concrete policies available
in Marmalade V2 are the Guard Policy, Collection Policy, Non-fungible Policy,
and Royalty Policy.

## The Guard Policy

This policy ensures the initiation of a guard with each Marmalade activity.
Guards are optional but recommended, as they help prevent unauthorised entities
from minting tokens without permission.

## The Collection Policy

This policy allows the creation of collections with pre-defined token lists,
enabling easier organisation and categorisation of NFTs.

## The Non-fungible Policy

This policy sets the token supply to 1 and precision to 0, effectively making
the token non-fungible. This is useful when creating unique, one-of-a-kind
digital assets.

## The Royalty Policy

This policy allows creators to define an account that receives royalties
whenever an NFT is sold. This provides a mechanism for creators to earn ongoing
rewards from the sales of their NFTs.

The great thing about concrete policies is that they offer a straightforward and
flexible ways to enhance their NFTs with new and exciting capabilities. With
concrete policies, Marmalade V2 makes the process of creating and managing NFTs
more accessible and efficient, enabling a wider range of individuals and
projects to participate in Kadena's NFT ecosystem.
