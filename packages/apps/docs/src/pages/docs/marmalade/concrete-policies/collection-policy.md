# Collection Policy

Marmalade's
[Collection Policy](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/concrete-policies/collection-policy/collection-policy-v1.pact)
is a policy designed for creators or operators to organise their tokens into a
curated group, just like creating an art gallery or a collection of precious
items. Imagine you have a bunch of unique tokens, each representing something
special to you. With the Collection Policy, you can gather these tokens into a
curated group called a "Collection."

Creating an NFT collection in this example could be seen as curating an art
exhibition in a digital realm. It's a captivating process where you bring
together unique creations under a single theme or concept. Here's a simplified
step-by-step guide on how to create an NFT collection.

**Step 1: The Birth of the Collection**

Creating a collection is the first and one of the most exciting steps. It's akin
to establishing a new art gallery. You're essentially giving life to a new space
that will host a collection of unique pieces of digital art. This process
involves defining the name of your collection and the maximum size it can have.
In the virtual world of code, it's as simple as calling the
[create-collection](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/concrete-policies/collection-policy/collection-policy-v1.pact#L54)
function and setting the parameters. In the art analogy, it's deciding the name
of your gallery and how much wall space you have for the artworks.

**Step 2: Crafting the Tokens**

The second step involves crafting the tokens. In the art world, this would be
the equivalent of creating the individual pieces of art that would be displayed
in the gallery. In the NFT space, this involves two sub-steps.

First, you
[create a token-ID](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/ledger.pact#L192).
This is a unique identifier for your NFT. This can be likened to giving a unique
name to each artwork in your gallery. Each token-ID is created with specific
policies attached to it. You can think of these policies as the rules and
guidelines attached to each artwork. These rules could be about ownership,
transferability, and even royalty distribution.

Alternatively, you could also create your custom policies that best fit your
needs.

The second sub-step is creating the actual token. This process utilizes the
token-ID created previously and embeds all the related details into the token.
If a
[royalty-policy](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/concrete-policies/royalty-policy/royalty-policy-v1.pact)
is used, you must provide a
[royalty_spec](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/concrete-policies/royalty-policy/royalty-policy-v1.pact#L17)
detailing the royalty rate, the form of payment, and the creator's details.

**Step 3: Minting - The Final Touch**

The final step is minting the token. Minting is like the grand opening of your
art gallery. This is the process where the token (or digital art piece) is
officially issued and added to the blockchain, making it a part of the digital
art ecosystem. Once minted, the token now exists and can be purchased, sold, or
held just like an artwork in a gallery.

In conclusion, creating a collection of NFTs can be seen as a beautiful blend of
technology and artistry. Each step, from the birth of the collection, crafting
the tokens, to the final act of minting, is a delicate process that brings
together creativity and programming prowess to curate a unique digital
experience.

With the Collection Policy, you have the power to showcase your creativity and
share your favorite tokens in a safe and organised way.
