# Why v2

So, why did we decide to embrace this evolution from Marmalade v1 to v2? It's
pretty simple - we're all about growth, innovation, and responding to the needs
of our vibrant community.

The digital world is ever-changing and full of exciting opportunities. To keep
you ahead of the curve, we need to be adaptable, we need to evolve, and most
importantly, we need to listen to you, our dedicated developers and users.

Next to our own provided well needed improvements the transition to v2 was a
also a response to your feedback, and your requirements. We heard you loud and
clear, and we incorporated your thoughts into these changes. Our aim? To make
Marmalade more functional, versatile, and user-friendly.

One of the major updates in v2 is the **Token Policy** model. We've moved away
from a single policy approach, and instead, we now support multiple policies.
This decision came about to accommodate a wider range of applications and
provide a more flexible environment - just like you asked.

We've also introduced a [Policy Manager](/marmalade/architecture/policy-manager)
to manage these policies more efficiently. Instead of invoking functions
directly from each policy as we used to, we now call them from this central hub,
making policy enforcement smoother and more streamlined.

We've made the move from On-chain manifest to Off-chain URI to standardise token
data retrieval. We've also encouraged the use of IPFS / ARWeave for off-chain
data hosting for a more decentralized approach, which many of you advocated for.

In summary, we're convinced that this shift to Marmalade v2 is a huge step
forward. It's not just about us, it's about you too. It's about embracing
change, optimising processes, and staying at the forefront of technological
progress.
