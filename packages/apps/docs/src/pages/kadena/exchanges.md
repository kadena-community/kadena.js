# Kadena Exchanges

A summary of the key features supported by the exchanges trading KDA.

Blockchain transactions are irreversible and if you make a mistake, your coins
may not be recoverable. A best practice with any blockchain is to always perform
a small test transaction when executing a transfer for the first time. For added
security, send those coins back to the sender to verify that the receiver's
account works as expected.

The main purpose of a cryptocurrency exchange is to allow users to buy and sell
coins. They may also allow users to transfer their coins to some other wallet.
Exchanges generally do not support the full range of features enabled by many
blockchains, including Kadena.

When withdrawing from exchanges or transferring KDA, be sure to follow the
k:account protocol to protect your funds on the receiving account.
