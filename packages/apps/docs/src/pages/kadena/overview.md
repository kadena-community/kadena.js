# Overview of Kadena

## Why Kadena Matters

### Vision

[Kadena](https://www.kadena.io) was founded on the idea that blockchain could
revolutionize how the world interacts and transacts. But in order to reach mass
adoption, chain technology and the ecosystem connecting it to the business world
needed to be reimagined from the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary
chain architecture and created the tools to make blockchain work for business.
Previously thought unachievable, Kadena has been able to become the first and
only Layer-1 blockchain that permanently addresses scalability while preserving
the power of Proof-of-Work (PoW) security and decentralization.

### Behind the tech

Prior to the launch of Kadena in 2016, our founders were already leaders in
blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions:

- Stuart Popejoy led JPMorgan‚Äôs Emerging Blockchain group.
- Will Martino was recruited from his role as the Tech Lead for the SEC‚Äôs
  Cryptocurrency Steering Committee.
- Together, Stuart and Will built JPMorgan‚Äôs first blockchain, now known as JPM
  Coin.

Kadena‚Äôs advisory team consists of experts such as Dr. Stuart Haber, the
co-inventor of blockchain and the most cited author in Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs
renowned 2008 Bitcoin white paper.

| üèó **Complete decentralized infrastructure for builders** | Kadena is the only platform offering a complete decentralized infrastructure for builders. Combining a revolutionary chain architecture with the tools needed for widespread adoption, your teams get the full capabilities of blockchain with the ability to go from concept to launch in days vs. months by not having to build from scratch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ‚úÖ **Safer smart contracts**                              | Pact makes designing safer smart contracts effortless, whether you‚Äôre writing your first contract or launching your fiftieth dApp. It‚Äôs fundamentally different from other contract languages. It‚Äôs readable by non-developers. It automatically detects bugs, freeing you from the exploits you‚Äôll face on Ethereum and other less safe platforms. And it has been battle-tested in production applications for over two years.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ‚úç**Write the future on Pact**                            | Pact is the first truly human readable smart contract language. It lets anyone write clearly, directly and safely onto a blockchain‚Äîa true advance for automated contracts. Pact automatically detects bugs and keeps the purpose of code clear. With other contract languages, finding bugs and making sense of fine print can be nearly impossible. Pact‚Äôs Formal Verification lets you test your contracts to make sure they do what‚Äôs intended. Additionally, when you reference code from other contracts, you stay in control of what happens with your transactions, even if they change their code. |
| ‚öñ **Industrial scalability**                             | Unlike other platforms, Kadena is designed to power global financial systems. Our protocol continually scales to higher TPS (Transactions Per Second) as more chains are added to the network. With its revolutionary multi-chain architecture, Kadena is the only scalable layer-1 Proof of Work (PoW) platform capable of scaling to settle the 9+ million trades executed on the NYSE each day.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| üîê **Proven security**                                    | Our founders' experience at JPMorgan revealed the potential for ‚Äì and limitations of ‚Äì existing blockchain solutions. In order to solve for the security and throughput demands of financial services clients, Kadena‚Äôs protocol runs on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism found in Bitcoin, rather than Proof of Stake (PoS). To achieve Kadena‚Äôs breakthrough scalability, we braid together multiple Bitcoin-like chains, improving both throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and integrity found in Bitcoin.                                                             |
| ‚õî **No-cost transactions**                               | While we offer marginal transaction fees for consumers, we‚Äôve gone a step further in introducing the first Crypto Gas Stations to allow businesses to eliminate all transaction fees for their customers, thus removing a key barrier to mass adoption of dApps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| üåê **The ideal ecosystem**                                | Kadena works with your preferred services, so you can build how you want and where you want. Empowered with our ecosystem of product and service integrations across enterprises, mining, DeFi, oracles, interoperability, smart contracts, wallets and exchanges, our passionate community of builders, miners, and partners is changing how the world interacts and transacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
