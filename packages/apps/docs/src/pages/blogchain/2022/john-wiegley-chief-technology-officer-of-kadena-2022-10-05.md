# John Wiegley: Chief Technology Officer of Kadena

Kadena is extremely thrilled to announce that John Wiegley has been promoted to
Chief Technology Officer! John was previously Kadena’s Lead Architect/Engineer
where his primary role was to learn the ins and outs of the Kadena system with a
core focus on PACT development while supporting a range of other technology
priorities.

John’s background includes more than three decades of impressive experience
across software engineering and programming, having traversed many languages and
applications that ranged from straight C-style languages, to object-oriented and
functional styles of programming. In addition, John worked for a variety of
Haskell projects, and for the last four years, also worked at DFINITY as a
verification, modeling and implementation engineer, where he solidified his
blockchain proof of work and modeling experience during this tenure using
Haskell, Rust and Coq. John also maintained the Free Software Foundation’s GNU
Emacs application and served for 15 years as a member of the C++ Standards
Committee.

With respect to John’s promotion, Kadena’s CEO Stuart Popejoy, states,

> *“*Kadena has always been about building the best technology to move crypto
> and web3 forward, so we are beyond thrilled to bring on someone as capable,
> experienced and visionary as John, who uniquely understands how PACT and
> scalable blockchain technology can take the whole industry forward.”

As CTO, John will be focused on building the appropriate technical direction,
creating a product roadmap, and overseeing how Kadena’s technology is
contributing to Kadena’s business development in order to turbocharge mainstream
adoption.

With respect to his promotion, John states,

> “I am very grateful to Stuart, Will, Doug and the rest of the leadership team
> for their confidence and support during this transition. The work at Kadena is
> very interesting, and I see many exciting challenges ahead, but right now what
> makes me happiest is this particular group of people, and the way they
> approach the work we do and each other. The more I experienced how Kadena
> works, and learned about the opportunities in front of us, the more I realized
> there is greater impact to be made by serving this team in a facilitating role
> as CTO.”

In addition to John’s accomplishments, John is also renowned in the open source
community for his contributions to Emacs editor and creation of the Ledger
double-entry accounting program.

The Kadena team is extremely thrilled for John and is excited to see him lead
Kadena’s future growth in scalability and security to the next level!
