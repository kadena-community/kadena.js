JUNE 17, 2019 — Kadena was proud to have our Head of Research & Networks,
**Monica Quaintance**, on

cryptocurrency news, as she shared her thoughts on the future of blockchain and
its adoption.

Some highlights from Monica’s segment on Bloomberg TV:

- **Walmart’s new drug supply chain blockchain use case**: We see this as a
  great example of how blockchain’s immutable tracking can help businesses
  innovate. “The idea is you can track drug information when drugs have been
  created at their source and each way through the supply chain, and when you
  pick up your prescription, you can trust that it has been verified along the
  chain.” For more on what a hybrid blockchain can do to unlock trapped
  liquidity,

- **Facebook’s stablecoin**: “This represents another company that has large
  institutional value demonstrating that they think blockchain is a way for them
  to move forward in the future.”

- **The future of cryptocurrency**: “Apple has already said they will support
  cryptocurrency in the next version of iOS, so I _do_ think that we are going
  to see lots of big companies jumping [on] the blockchain trend. We’re working
  with a large insurance company, a $3B asset manager… so there’s a lot of
  opportunities out there in integrating blockchain technology into real
  business.”

- **When will blockchain go “mainstream?”**: “At least in the next five years,
  we will begin to see real products that actually touch the end consumer…you’ll
  start seeing people using applications backed by blockchain without even
  knowing it.” Want to learn more about Monica’s vision of blockchain?
