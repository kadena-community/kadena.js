# Clarification to the 2021 Token Economics Update

At [Kadena](https://kadena.io/), we’re proud of our token economic model, as it
provides robust rewards for the miners who keep our network running, and funds
all the critical initiatives that drive adoption on the platform. In January
2021, working closely with our incredible community, Kadena announced a major
[update to our token economic model in January 2021](/blogchain/2021/update-to-the-kadena-token-economic-model-2021-01-29).

To briefly recap that article, Kadena’s model offers the most decentralized
distribution of any modern layer-1, with 70% of all token emissions going to
miners, who also represent all governance of the actual network, thanks to
Proof-of-Work. 1% was burned at launch, 9% was released over the first two years
to contributors (3%) and investors and strategic collaborators (6%), while 20%
constitutes the _platform share_, which can be used to fund all activities for
maintaining and growing the network. See the original article for more details
on how these are deployed.

The change announced in 2021 dramatically reduced the emission rate of the
platform share. Initially planned to distribute over 5 years after launch,
Kadena committed to extending this release cycle to 10 years. This was an
important correction as it reduced platform emissions to not exceed mining
emissions, and extended our timeline to deploy the platform share to help grow
the network and drive adoption.

Since then, the community has asked for more clarity surrounding the exact
emission rate. Indeed, some of the graphics in that article, which focused on
comparing platform emissions to mining emissions but did not illustrate the
remaining 9%, added to the confusion by showing totals that did not line up with
the actual coins in circulation. Finally, even though we have long offered
[open-source tables of all emissions](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-data/tree/master/haskell-src/data),
the community wanted a clear, cumulative dataset of all KDA cumulative emissions
to eliminate confusion.

## Cumulative KDA Emissions In Pictures

The above chart shows the entire emission of KDA, from launch in 2019 to the
cessation of mining rewards in 2139 (!). “Other” groups Strategic-Investor and
Contributor shares, which finished emission in October 2022. Platform emission
completes November 2029, as shown in the detail below. After November 2029, all
KDA emissions will be for mining only.

## Cumulative KDA Emissions in Numbers

We’re also happy to provide
[the cumulative data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJgDxTb2lo7dC7_1-JKRFW22fKLmgor8/view?usp=drive_link)
month-by-month for the entire emission of KDA. Note that the data indicates the
cumulative amount at the _end_ of the month, not the beginning. Specific
emissions can as always be found in the open-source data linked above.

## Conclusion

This article is intended to help further illustrate the Kadena token economic
model, but there are many more stories to tell about the exciting happenings at
Kadena, including all the great grant-funded projects coming online in Q3 and Q4
2023, as well as amazing new initiatives in layer-2, ZK technology, smart
wallets and more.
