# Project Spotlight: KadenAI

Welcome to the [Kadena](https://kadena.io/) Project Spotlight Series, where we
highlight the groundbreaking work of organizations currently building and
innovating on the Kadena blockchain!

Today, we’re shining the spotlight on \*\*\*\*KadenAI, an innovative platform
engineered to enhance the creator experience in the NFT space. KadenAI offers a
suite of comprehensive tools designed to facilitate the creation of NFT
collections. These tools include, but are not limited to, NFT minters, utility
generators, and AI-powered image generation.

KadenAI is built with
[Marmalade](/blogchain/2023/introducing-marmalade-v2-empowering-the-future-of-nfts-2023-06-16),
Kadena’s NFT standard. Marmalade provides the flexibility of customizing and
stacking features, also known as policies, on top of NFTs. The stackable
policies simplify the NFT creation process, enabling KadenAI to rapidly deploy
unique NFT collections without concerns about underlying code complexities.

### How does KadenaAI work? Specifically, how can you generate an NFT with no code?

KadenAI streamlines the NFT creation process through an intuitive, no-code
interface. The following is a simplified guide on how to generate NFTs with
KadenAI’s generator tool:

1.  Create Images and Metadata: Utilize our generator tool to upload image
    layers and generate final images and metadata.

2.  Create NFT Policy: Use our user-friendly interface to create your NFT
    policy.

3.  Begin minting: Start minting NFTs with or without a collection.

4.  Complete: Your NFT is now minted and will now appear on our marketplace.

For a more comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to generate an NFT, please
check out this [\*\*Youtube](https://youtu.be/UHza2oUwQ2E)\*\* tutorial.

### Does KadenAI provide the user the ability to create collections with different rarities, utilities, etc.?

Absolutely. KadenAI offers an exceptional creation experience, enabling users to
craft unique NFT collections with different rarities. Our collection generator
empowers users to customize their artwork into distinctive collections.
Moreover, metadata is provided for each NFT, allowing users to access a detailed
summary of every piece within a collection.

### How will my collection show up on the KadenAI marketplace?

Once your NFT collection is minted, it will undergo an approval process to
ensure quality and adherence to our standards. Once approved, your collection
will be prominently displayed on the KadenAI marketplace, ready for viewing and
trading.

### Do I need to upload my images to IPFS?

No. KadenAI manages the entire process from start to finish, including uploading
your images and metadata through the minting process. We have streamlined this
process to make it as user-friendly and efficient as possible, removing any
friction when interacting with the blockchain.

### How does KadenAI generate its revenue?

Similar to most NFT marketplaces, KadenAI generates revenue by charging fees for
minting, selling, and auctioning NFTs on our platform. These fees support our
continuous efforts to provide a unique and innovative user experience.
Additionally, we engage in strategic partnerships to build custom NFT tools
which we hope will evolve into a paid service offering for our users in the near
future.

### What can we expect from KadenAI in 6 months? In 1 year?

In the upcoming 6 months, we anticipate KadenAI to have developed a user
experience that seamlessly merges usability and innovation. The goal is to
enhance Kadena’s NFT marketplace features and offer unique community engagement
through our innovative Discord bots.

By the 1-year milestone, we hope to expand our ecosystem with more NFT tooling,
AI-driven metadata, and image generation capabilities. Furthermore, we plan to
introduce integrations that support blockchain developers in the ecosystem.

### What inspired the creation and development of KadenAI? What has it been like building on Kadena and Marmalade?

What inspired us to create KadenAI was the opportunity to deliver a low-code
platform that empowers creators and projects by removing technological barriers.

Building with Marmalade has provided our team with insights into diverse NFT
implementations within the ecosystem. Additionally, leveraging Marmalade’s fully
functional ledger has allowed us to fully concentrate on product development
without worrying about underlying complexities.

Many thanks to KadenAI for taking the time to share with our community details
about its visionary project and their experience building with Marmalade! We’ll
be featuring more Project Spotlights in the coming weeks, so stay tuned as we
continue to profile innovative projects that are currently building on Kadena.
