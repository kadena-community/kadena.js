# Marmalade Made Easy

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm,
revolutionizing the way we buy, sell, and trade digital assets. These unique
digital tokens represent ownership of a wide range of digital and physical
items, from artwork to collectibles, music, and more. To facilitate the creation
and exchange of NFTs, various NFT standards, such as the ERC-721, have emerged,
each with its own set of rules and specifications.

Among these NFT standards, [Marmalade](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade),
powered by Kadena, stands out as one of the most unique and innovative
standards. Marmalade is set to provide the complete infrastructure to seamlessly
create & launch a game-changing NFT experience.

In this article, we will explore the concept of NFT standards, highlight some of
the challenges facing existing standards, and delve into the distinct features
that set Marmalade apart from the rest.

## What is an NFT standard?

An NFT standard refers to a set of rules and specifications that dictate how
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are created, stored, and interacted with on a
particular blockchain.

Standards are essential because they ensure interoperability and compatibility
between different NFT platforms, wallets, and marketplaces. They provide a
common framework for developers to create and manage NFTs, making it easier for
users to understand how these tokens work and to trade them across various
ecosystems.

The most well-known and earliest NFT standard is the ERC-721. It is an
Ethereum-based standard used to create indivisible and unique tokens, making it
suitable for digital art and collectibles.

## Challenges with Existing NFT Standards

Despite the success and widespread adoption of NFTs, several challenges persist
within existing NFT standards.

1. Scalability Issues and High Gas Fees Many NFT standards, particularly those
   on the Ethereum blockchain, face scalability issues. This results in high gas
   fees and slow transaction times during periods of high demand, making NFT
   creation, buying, and selling expensive and inconvenient.

2. High Transaction Fees or Non-transparent Fee Structure

   Transaction fees on blockchain networks can be prohibitively high, especially
   during network congestion. This impacts the profitability and accessibility
   of NFT marketplaces.

3. Lack of Built-in Mechanisms for Specific Requirements NFT standards typically
   lack built-in mechanisms to enforce specific requirements during NFT sales,
   such as royalties, leaving this responsibility to external platforms and
   mechanisms.

4. Limited Secondary Market Control Original creators often have little control
   over subsequent sales and pricing on secondary markets, impacting long-term
   value appreciation.

1. Marmalade, developed on the Kadena blockchain, addresses many of the
   challenges present in existing NFT standards, offering several unique
   solutions

   On-Chain Royalties/Enforceable Royalties: Marmalade includes built-in
   mechanisms for enforcing royalties during NFT sales, ensuring that creators
   are fairly compensated for their work for every single transaction.

2. Escrow Accounts

   With its integrated escrow accounts for NFT transactions, Marmalade
   guarantees the safety of both buyers and sellers, delivering an outstanding
   user experience and ensuring flawlessly secure and trust-free transactions
   for complete peace of mind.

3. Limitless Customization with “Token Policies”

   Marmalade empowers creators with a dynamic platform, allowing them to craft
   and personalize features, or “policies”, uniquely suited to their NFTs. With
   a user-friendly toolset, the NFT creation process is made remarkably
   straightforward. Creators wield full authority over the issuance of their
   NFTs, with the ability to finely tune factors such as total supply (the
   number of NFTs in circulation) and the allocation of units for transfer. This
   flexibility and adaptability are at the core of Marmalade’s distinctive
   appeal, enabling creators to fully realize their vision and tailor their NFT
   projects to their specific needs.

4. Minimal Gas Fees Marmalade significantly reduces or eliminates gas fees,
   making it more cost-effective for artists and collectors to participate in
   the NFT market. Marmalade is powered by Pact, Kadena’s smart contract
   language. Pact allows NFT projects to optimize the user experience by
   integrating “gas stations” into their applications. These “gas stations”
   serve as mechanisms for covering the expenses tied to blockchain
   transactions. Consequently, users can seamlessly generate NFTs without the
   need to directly engage with the intricacies of blockchain technology. This
   streamlined process ensures a user-friendly and efficient experience, devoid
   of the complexities typically associated with blockchain interactions.

### An Elevated NFT Experience

Marmalade’s unwavering commitment to democratizing NFT creation is a commendable
endeavor that aims to redefine the way we approach digital art and collectibles.
By removing barriers and making this innovative technology accessible to a
broader spectrum of individuals, Marmalade is opening the doors to a new era of
artistic and collectible expression.

Get ready to elevate the NFT experience as we pave the way for a more diverse,
scalable, and secure future.
