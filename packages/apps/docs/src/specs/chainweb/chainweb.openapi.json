This allows for\nunlimited transaction throughput by horizontally scaling the number of chains.\n\nFeedback and bug reports for the content of this site are welcome.

Miners are allowed,  but not required, to update the time to reflect the solve time for the block more closely.\nA larger value for the creation time increases the accuracy of difficulty adjustment which is in the interest of miners -- the high difficulty guarantees that the outcome of the race of winning blocks is determined by actual hash power. However, blocks that are predated (i.e. have a creation time that is in the future) are rejected during block header validation.
