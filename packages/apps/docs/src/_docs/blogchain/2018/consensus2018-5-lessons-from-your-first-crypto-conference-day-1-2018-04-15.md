# #Consensus2018: 5 Lessons from Your First Crypto Conference (Day 1)

### What to do when they bring the lambos to your doorstep

Lesson #1: Prepare for a line to registration that represents the fundamental
problems of throughput and congestion for blockchain as a whole.

Lesson #2: Give bonuses to your developers who agree to a live demo. I failed to
realize the insanity of the proposition until one of the more tech savvy
audience members asked a dev to code for him a particular line of smart contract

Lesson #3: Be prepared to have a nuanced debate about diversity and gender
representation in blockchain via T-Shirts.

Lesson #4: Always ask — at what odds? And also, what is my buyout for this
wager?

Lesson #5: Realize your one block sponsorship still cost more than the 10 rented
lambos they parked outside the conference.
