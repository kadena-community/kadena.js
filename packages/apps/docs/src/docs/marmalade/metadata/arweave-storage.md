# Leveraging Arweave in Marmalade with Akord

Given the immutable characteristic of NFTs, the associated data's long-term
accessibility and sustainability are critical aspects to consider. Akord has
emerged as a powerful tool to handle these requirements, and its importance is
underscored in the context of Marmalade.

Arweave is a pioneering protocol designed to modernise the internet's
foundational structures, augmenting its capacity for storing, addressing, and
accessing data. This technology is central to our approach to dealing with NFT
data, ensuring its perpetual availability and integrity and thereby
strengthening the overall dependability of the NFTs hosted on Marmalade.

## What is Akord?

Akord is a platform built on the Arweave blockchain that helps NFT projects and creators get the most out of permanent storage and data ownership. Akord facilitates easy uploading to Arweave, caching, reposting, file management, end-to-end encryption, notifications, token-gated access, private messaging, note creation and more. 

Everything in Akord happens through public or private digital vaults, where you can invite others and set access control. 

### How is Akord different?
While there are other products that also provide data storage on Arweave, Akord has some key differentiating features.

1. **The easiest and cheapest way to upload to Arweave**. Akord makes it simple to upload to Arweave via the [API](https://docs.akord.com/api-and-dev-tools/quickest-way-to-upload-to-arweave), [CLI](https://docs.akord.com/api-and-dev-tools/build/cli) or [app](https://v2.akord.com/signup).

2. **A secure space to manage on-chain data**. Akord’s advanced system of end-to-end encryption not only secures your files and messages, but uses key rotation to facilitate collaboration within private vaults.
  
4. **A focus on user experience for developers and end users**. Akord’s vision is to make the power of web3 accessible to everyone, a vision shared by Kadena.
