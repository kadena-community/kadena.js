Pact is a smart contract programming language, specifically designed for correct, transactional execution on the Kadena high-performance blockchain.

The reference information for the Pact programming language covers the following topics:

- [Syntax and keywords](/reference/syntax) provides a quick reference to the language syntax and how to declare different types.
- [Pact functions](/reference/functions) describes all of the native, built-in functions in the Pact programming languages organized into different categories
- [Property validation](/reference/property-checking) explains how you can use Pact property checking to validate your code and the properties and invariants you can use to test the code for correctness.
- [Sequenced pacts](/reference/pacts) highlights the use of multi-step transactions using pact definitions.
- [Pact REPL](/reference/pact-repl) provides command-line reference information for the Pact REPL interactive command-line program.
- [Pact REST API](/reference/rest-api) describes the Pact REST API and how you can use it to interact with the blockchain.

For information about the design of the Pact programming language, see the [Pact white paper](/kadena) or the [Pact home page](https://www.kadena.io/pact).
