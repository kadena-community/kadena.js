# Chainweb clients

Kadena Chainweb client libraries are application programming interfaces that provide TypeScript-based calls for interacting with Chainweb node endpoints on the Kadena network.

The following client libraries are available to download as packages or to clone from the [kadena.js](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js) repository for further community-based development:

- [chainweb-node-client](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-node-client)
- [chainweb-stream-client](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-stream-client)
- [chainwebjs](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainwebjs)

## chainweb-node-client

The `@kadena/chainweb-node-client` library provides typed JavaScript wrapper functions that enable you to call `chainweb-node` API [peer-to-peer](/reference/chainweb-api) and [Pact](/reference/rest-api) endpoints.
Most of the functions in this library are replaced by functions provided in the `@kadena/client` library.

For more information, see [Chainweb node client](/reference/chainweb-ref/node-client) or the [chainweb-node-client README](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-node-client).

## chainweb-stream-client

The `@kadena/chainweb-stream-client` library is an experimental library for browsers and node.js that enables you to stream account, module, transaction, and event information, including confirmation depth.
The alpha version of the `chainweb-stream-client` package introduces basic functions for connecting to Chainweb nodes, checking client to server compatibility, and confirming transaction status.

For more information, see [Chainweb streaming client](/reference/chainweb-ref/stream-client) or the [chainweb-stream-client README](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-stream-client).

## chainwebjs

The `@kadena/chainweb-stream-client` library provides high level Typescript bindings and types for retrieving information from the Chainweb node API.
This package includes functions for retrieving block headers, block payloads, transactions, and events from transaction outputs. 

For more information, see [Bindings and types](/reference/chainweb-ref/js-bindings) or the [chainwebjs README](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainwebjs).
