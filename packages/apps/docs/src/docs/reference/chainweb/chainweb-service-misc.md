# Maintenance and other services endpoints

There are several endpoints you can use to query or update information about a Chainweb node, including its current configuration and availability.

## Start a backup job

Use `POST http://{baseURL}/make-backup` to start a backup job for a Chainweb node.
Starting a backup job creates a UNIX timestamp identifier for the job.
You can then use the identifier to check the status of the job to determine if the job is still in progress or the backup has been completed.

If a backup job is already in progress, this endpoint returns the UNIX timestamp job identifier instead of starting a new backup job.

### Enable backups

The `POST http://{baseURL}/make-backup` endpoint is only valid if you enable the backup API for a node.
You can enable the backup API by starting the node with the `--enable-backup-api` and `--backup-directory` command-line options or by specifying the following configuration settings in the node configuration file:

```yaml
backup:
  api:
    enabled: true
  directory: path-to-backups-directory
```

### Select a backup directory

If you enable the backup API, sending a request the `POST http://{baseURL}/make-backup` endpoint always backs up the RocksDB portion of the Chainweb database.

In most cases, you should locate the backup directory in the same partition as the active RocksDB database.
Storing RocksDB backups in the same partition as the active RocksDB database minimizes the space required and the time it takes to complete backups initially.
Over time—as the active database diverges from the backup copy—the space required will increase. 
If you store the backup on another partition, the backup operation takes longer and the backup copy requires as much disk space as the active RocksDB database.

### Back up the Pact database

Chainweb nodes have two separate databases.
One database—the RocksDB database—stores information about blocks and chains.
A second database—the Pact Sqlite database—stores information about smart contracts and state. 

While backup jobs always back up the RocksDB database, backing up the Pact Sqlite database is optional.
If you include the `backupPact` parameter in your request, the backup job backs up both databases.
Backing up both databases takes much longer than only backing up the RockDB database.
In addition, Pact database backups always require as much space as the active Pact database.

### Define a retention policy

Database backup jobs don't provide any type of automatic backup retention policy.
You should define your own policy and delete old backup copies, as appropriate.

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Description
| --------- | -----------
| backupPact | Indicates that you want to back up both the RockDB database and the Pact database. This option requires additional disk space and increases the time required to complete the backup.

### Responses

Requests to the `POST http://{baseURL}/make-backup` endpoint return the following response code:

- **200 OK** indicates that a backup job has been created.

## Check node health

Use `GET http://{baseURL}/health-check` to check whether `chainweb-node` is running and responding to API requests. 
To check the state of consensus, you should use the `GET https://{baseURL}/cut` endpoint instead of this endpoint.

### Responses

Requests to the `/health-check` endpoint return the following response code:

- **200 OK** indicates that the node is running and responding to API requests.

#### Response header

The response header parameters are the same for all successful and unsuccessful Chainweb node requests.

## Blocks event stream

Use `GET http://{baseURL}/header/updates` to connect to a source of server events that emits a BlockHeader event for each new block header that is added to the chain database of the remote node.

The stream can contain blocks that might later become orphaned. 
To address this potential issue, you should buffer events on the client side for the most recent block heights to allow for a desired confirmation depth to be reached.

You should note that the server might terminate this event stream from time to time.
It is up to the client to restart event streaming with a new request.

### Responses

- **200 OK** indicates a successful requests and results in a stream of BlockHeader events. 
  Each event consists of an event property and a data property and are separated by empty lines. 

#### Response header

The response header parameters are the same for all successful and unsuccessful Chainweb node requests.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| x-peer-addr | string | Specifies the host address and port number of the client as observed by the remote Chainweb node. The host address can be a domain name or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6 format. For example: `"10.36.1.3:42988"`.
| x-server&#8209;timestamp | integer&nbsp;>=&nbsp;0 | Specifies the clock time of the remote Chainweb node using the UNIX epoch timestamp. For example: `1618597601`.
| x&#8209;chainweb&#8209;node&#8209;version	| string | Specifies the version of the remote Chainweb node. For example: `"2.23"`.

#### Response schema

If the request is successful, the response returns `text/event-stream` content with the following:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -----------
| event | string | Specifies the type of event with the event property value of "BlockHeader".
| data	| object | Specifies the data properties for the event.

### Examples

You can send a request for block header updates from the Kadena main network like this:


```Postman
GET http://api.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/header/updates
```

This request returns a stream of events with the BlockHeader event property and a data property:
