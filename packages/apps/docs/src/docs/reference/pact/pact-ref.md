# Pact functions

Pact is a smart contract programming language, specifically designed for correct, transactional execution on the Kadena high-performance blockchain.
The language includes many native, built-in functions to perform common programming tasks and to perform operations that are unique to the Pact programming language.

You can find reference information for all of the the Pact built-in functions in the following topics:

- [General purpose functions](/reference/functions/general) are used to perform many common tasks, such as specifying the character set for a smart contract, concatenating a list of strings, or defining a unique namespace for your applications.

- [Database functions](/reference/functions/database) are used to perform database-related tasks, such as creating new tables, reading data from an existing table, or updating table records.

- [Time functions](/reference/functions/time) are used to manage and manipulate time-based information and formats.

- [Operator functions](/reference/functions/operators) are used to tell the compiler the specific type of mathematical or logical action you want to perform.

- [Keyset functions](/reference/functions/keysets) are used to define and manage security through the handling of the public keys required to sign transactions.
  
- [Guard functions](/reference/functions/guards) are used to create and manage account principals and security enforcement.

- [Capabilities functions](/reference/functions/capabilities) are used to define and manage the permissions that authorize or deny access to smart contract operations.

- [Repl-only functions functions](/reference/functions/repl-only-functions) are used in the interactive Pact REPL to enable testing.

- [Simple payment verification (spv) functions](/reference/functions/spv) are used to verify payment payloads.

- [Commitment functions](/reference/functions/commitments) are used to handle specialized cryptographic operations.

- [Zero knowledge (zk) functions](/reference/functions/zk) are used to handle specialized zero knowledge operations.
