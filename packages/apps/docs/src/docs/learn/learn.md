# Engage and learn the fundamentals

If you're new to cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and decentralized platforms, start here to learn the basics, including how the internet is evolving in the direction of Web3, the problems of security, scalability, and centralization, and the core concepts and design principles at the heart of the Kadena network and Kadena ecosystem.

This part of the Kadena Docs site is for concepts, foundational information, and terminology for anyone interested in blockchain and decentralized application use cases. 
You should start here to learn the basics about blockchains, cryptography, consensus, Kadena, and more.
