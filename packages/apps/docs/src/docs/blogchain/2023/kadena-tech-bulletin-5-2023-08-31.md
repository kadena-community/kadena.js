# Kadena Tech Bulletin #5

Welcome to the 5th issue of The Kadena Tech Bulletin!

Whether you are already familiar with Kadena or just learning about it for the
first time, the Kadena Tech Bulletin provides a short technical overview of how
we are revolutionizing the blockchain industry, one block at a time. From Pact
to Chainweb, to how we are refining our builder onboarding process, we will
provide our community of builders and developers with all the updates and tools
needed to help nurture and scale their projects in our ever-growing ecosystem.

Here’s a recap of the last month:

### **1. LEDGER!**

After a long wait, you can now store your KDA tokens on Ledger! We are very
proud of the team at Kadena and the community for making this happen.

Read this
[article](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7415959614109?docs=true)
by Ledger Docs for a step-by-step guide to setting up your Ledger Kadena (KDA)
account and transferring your KDA tokens to a Ledger device.

### **2. Pact 4.8**

We’re excited to announce the release of Pact v 4.8!

This release brings a range of improvements, including bug fixes, updates to
formal verification, and internal changes that enhance the platform’s
performance, stability, and functionality.

### **3. Chainweb Stream**

Last month, we released the initial experimental version of Chainweb-stream
Server and Client. This new system enables the continuous streaming of
transactions, simplifying the process for projects to run their applications on
Kadena’s blockchain.

The Chainweb-stream-server functions as a “middleware” server, handling all
polling tasks on your behalf and exposing streams of transactions to clients.
Its counterpart, the Chainweb-stream-client, complements the server by offering
a consistent experience across different browsers and environments.

### **4. Launch of the Alpha Version of @kadena/client**

Kadena’s Developer Experience team is thrilled to announce the launch of the
alpha version of “@kadena/client,” which enables JavaScript/TypeScript users to
easily interact with the Kadena blockchain.

Moreover, @kadena/client also features a functional approach through
“@kadena/client/fp,” providing builders more flexibility in creating commands,
such as composing “command” or “lazy loading.”

### **5. Pact K:ourse is Ready**

The Kadena Academy team has been diligently working and is delighted to present
our first Pact K:ourse — “Mastering Functions in Pact”.

Elevate your developer skills and don’t forget to collect your Kadena Learning
Points along the way.

### **6. GitHub supports Syntax Highlight for Pact**

The anticipation has been long, but the wait is over! Finally, GitHub officially
supports syntax highlights for Pact. This update makes coding easier, faster,
and more efficient, thereby reducing errors and making code reviews smoother!
