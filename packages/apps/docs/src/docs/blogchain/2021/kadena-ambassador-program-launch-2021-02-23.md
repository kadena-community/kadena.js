# Kadena Ambassador Program Launch

Kadena is establishing its first-ever Ambassador Program to empower the
community to spread awareness and educate a wider audience about the potential
of Kadena’s blockchain technology. In order to drive the adoption of Kadena’s
Public Blockchain, the Ambassador Program will seek to accomplish several tasks:

- **Incentivize community members** to create informative collateral
- **Strengthen activity on our social media channels** with active moderators
- **Encourage the creation of community channels** to lead organic community
  growth

There are currently three pillars of the Ambassador Program: Content Creators,
Moderators, and Community Channel Leaders. Each one of these pillars is
essential in continuing to establish Kadena’s brand and presence in the crypto
community.

## Content Creators

Content Creators are one of the most crucial pillars of this program since they
have the ability to draw in new members to our community. Community members who
can create content, such as blogs, articles, graphic designs, podcasts, videos,
or tutorials, should apply to be a content creator. There are two possible
positions one can apply for: Contributor or Ambassador Content Creator.

**Contributors** are community members who have one-off ideas for content that
they want to create. This role is created for those who have 1–2 pieces of
content that they want to publish and want an easier process without the need to
sign an Ambassador agreement. However, what differentiates Contributors from
Ambassador Content Creators is that Ambassador Content Creators receive more
awards for creating content.

To become an **Ambassador Content Creator**, you must submit 2–3 contents you
have published in the past, Kadena related or not, as a way to see the quality
of your previous content. In addition, Ambassador Content Creators are able to
participate in discussions with team members regarding the project’s direction,
via a dedicated Ambassador channel and group calls.

Once approved to be a Contributor or Ambassador Content Creator, you’ll send
topics/type of content that you want to create and have it be accepted by
Kadena. After you have completed your content and have it fact checked by us, we
will send you the KDA net 30 days of receipt. Depending on the quality of your
work and your position, you can receive rewards from **$15 USD** to **$300
USD**, paid in KDA. You can find more details about the rubric for rewards on
our website [here](https://kadena.io/ambassador-program). For a list of content
ideas, we have a Content Quest Board with content suggested by the community
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-m50T5mnQv-4SKHrUBdadQqChbEBKvVHgPuze4PzAY/edit#gid=1395531297).

_At the time of the launch of the Ambassador Program, we will be limiting the
number of Ambassador Content Creators to 10._

## Moderators

Moderators are important in making Kadena’s social channels a welcoming
environment for new community members. While content creators are tasked with
creating content to draw in new members, Moderators play a crucial role in
providing up-to-date resources to new members. Moderators receive rewards for
moderating our social channels for **$75 USD** per month in KDA. The decision to
vote and choose new Moderators is determined by community members.

## Community Channel Leaders

Community channels are vital in facilitating discussions that are more niche
than in our own official channels. Whether these channels are used to discuss
ways to bring awareness to the crypto community or discuss Kadena in another
language, Kadena is determined to help foster organic community growth. There
will be two aspects of a community channel that we’ll support: the Community
Leaders and community events.

**Community Leaders** act similar to Moderators in our official channel in that
they are necessary for creating a welcoming environment for community members to
join into. When applying to be a Community Leader, you must give a brief
description of the community channel you want to create and explain how the
channel would be beneficial for spreading Kadena’s brand. In addition, Community
Leaders can create rules more or less strict than in our official channels.
However, Community Leaders must ensure that there is no misinformation being
spread and uphold Kadena’s brand and [Code of Conduct](https://www.kadena.io/community-guidelines).

Kadena recognizes that **community events** are crucial in bringing members
together to help spread Kadena’s brand. One example of a community-led event was
a community Twitter contest to see who can tweet and retweet the most. This
brought the community together to drive Kadena’s brand on a social media
platform. To encourage similar community events, we plan on funding
community-led events that seek to promote Kadena’s awareness.

_At the time of the launch of the Ambassador Program, we will be limiting the
number of community channels to 5._

## Ambassador Privileges

As community members who promote the best of Kadena, you get privileges such as:

- Token grants for contributions
- Exclusive Ambassador role on our Discord Server and Telegram Channel
- Dedicated invite-only Ambassador Channel on our Discord and Telegram
- Gain behind-the-scene access to the project’s roadmap
- More involvement in the project’s decision-making process by providing direct
  feedback to core team members

As we move into 2021 community is central to Kadena’s vision to shape the future
of blockchain, and the community has stepped up. As Kadena pushed announcements
on our social media platforms, members of our community were quick to engage,
amplify, and share. In turn, this naturally led to significant growth in our
community, in a virtuous cycle we want to turbocharge. With the launch of the
Ambassador Program, we want to expand and accelerate community growth by
empowering community members to create content, **guide** new members in our
community, and **lead** community channels. By working together with the
community through collaborative endeavors, we can show the wider crypto space
the potential of our blockchain platform and usher in a new era of limitless
scalability, security, and decentralization.
