# Kadena Engineering Updates Feb 2019

### A recap of recent features and upcoming milestones on our technical roadmap.

## Pact

### Done:

- **[Namespaces](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/pull/337):** an important
  milestone to make upgrading contracts easier and more user-friendly.

- **[Capabilities](/build/pact/advanced#capabilitiesh-1323277354#capabilities):**
  a recently merged new feature, provides the building blocks for upcoming work
  that will allow programmable governance of Pact smart contracts.

- **Formal verification improvements:** added support for lists and fully nested
  objects when writing property assertions.

### In progress:

- **Coin contract** and related infrastructure that will form the basis of the
  currency that accompanies Chainweb.

If you have Pact-related questions, ask them on **Stack Overflow** with the
**[Pact-Lang](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pact-lang)** tag.

## Public

### Done:

- **[Pact Test Net](https://pact.kadena.io/):** Significantly improved module
  explorer that allows you to call contracts with the click of a button instead
  of writing code.

- Support for formal verification in
  **[the Pact browser](http://kadena.io/try-pact/)**. For the first time ever,
  the power of formal verification is easily available to anyone interested in
  writing secure smart contracts.

### In progress:

- Chainweb Testnet: **Early Q2 2019**. (stay tuned for more updates!)

## Private

### Done:

- **[ScalableBFT: Community Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07MKMKP4F?qid=1547578126310/awssr=0-1/awsref_=srh_res_product_title)**
  is now on the AWS Marketplace: walk through the
  **[setup documentation](https://kadena-io.github.io/scalableBFT.github.io/)**,
  share your questions in the **[Kadena Discord](https://discord.gg/PvN7mG9)**
  chat.

### In progress:

- ScalableBFT implementation on Microsoft Azure.
