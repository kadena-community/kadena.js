# Kadena Presents “Blockchain Summer: The Road to Mainstream Adoption”

### Highlights from our panel discussion on what it will take for blockchain to go mainstream.

We were pleased to host our fellow NYC blockchain community members on
Wednesday, July 31 at our Brooklyn headquarters for a night of blockchain,
banter, and barbecue.

Our panelists [Tarun Chitra](http://twitter.com/tarunchitra), Founder and CEO of
[Gauntlet Networks](http://gauntlet.network), investor
[Arianna Simpson](http://twitter.com/ariannasimpson), and
[Eli Polanco,](https://twitter.com/elipoaquino) formerly of J.P. Morgan’s
blockchain team, joined Kadena Founder and President
[Stuart Popejoy](http://twitter.com/SirLensALot) and moderator
[Jon Victor](https://twitter.com/jon_victor_) from
[The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/reporters/jon-victor) to
discuss: What will it take for blockchain to go mainstream? How do we measure
adoption? How do we build trust in the wider world for blockchain?

We enjoyed a spirited discussion by our panelists, from how Paypal was a
precursor to blockchain peer-to-peer payments to different takes on how much
modern society already over-trusts technology.

Our favorite thought-provoking moments include:

- **Jon Victor** asking, “Is UX/UI the only thing mainstream adopters care
  about?” Our panelists cite other adoption concerns beyond UX/UI: from clients
  who want interoperability with existing database systems to, as **Eli
  Polanco** explains, governments whose support will actually facilitate access
  to underprivileged communities.

- **Arianna Simpson** commenting on how the conversation sparked by Facebook’s
  Libra “is good for everyone in blockchain” through the awareness that it
  raises. **Tarun Chitra**, who reviewed Libra’s code in his role at Gauntlet
  Networks, states that on the technical end, “Libra developers are confident”
  that their blockchain will be decentralized and distributed.

- **Stuart Popejoy** explaining how Kadena plans to address security and
  scalability, and how he believes, “The future of blockchain is going to be us,
  or look a lot like us.” His position is that competition in the blockchain
  space is “healthy” and welcomes the field of players in both enterprise and
  public blockchain.

We look forward to more conversations and community events. Stay tuned on our
social channels (below) for our next engagement!
