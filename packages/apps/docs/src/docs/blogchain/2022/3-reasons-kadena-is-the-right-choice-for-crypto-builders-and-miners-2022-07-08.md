# 3 Reasons Kadena Is The Right Choice For Crypto Builders And Miners

_An Open-Source, Public Blockchain Built with Proof of Work_

[Kadena](http://kadena.io) is a unique open-source, public blockchain. Kadena’s
entire architecture, from the blockchain technology to the smart contract
language, has been built from the ground up, solving the blockchain trilemma of
**security**, **decentralization**, and **scalability** — making it entirely
possible for the next generation of the Internet to be built on Kadena!

Here are three reasons why:

## 1. Pact: The Safe Smart Contract Language

Kadena designed Pact to deliver web3 innovation and fundamentals along with web2
usability. As an open-source, Turing-incomplete smart contract language, Pact
facilitates transactional logic with a fine-tuned mix of functionality in
authorization, data management, and workflow.

Pact ensures smart contracts only execute on a programmer’s intent, thus
offering a safer environment for conducting business. Executed directly on
ledger, Pact code is stored in a human-readable format as an immutable
transaction. Pact contracts can therefore be verified by non-programmers.

Pact is not like JavaScript or Solidity. Microsoft’s VBA, the programming
language to create simple Excel formulas, is a better comparison. Pact is a
smart contract language accessible to builders of any skill level, whether they
are novice JavaScript programmers or computer science PhDs. Developers enjoy
peace of mind with next-generation smart contracts built on Kadena with Pact.

## 2. Chainweb: A Modern Proof of Work

Kadena’s Chainweb, the protocol’s native consensus method, becomes increasingly
secure _and_ environmentally sustainable as chains deploy, because the amount of
mining hash power stays constant. It scales as additional chains are deployed on
the Kadena network. As we wrote in the
[Kadena white paper](https://d31d887a-c1e0-47c2-aa51-c69f9f998b07.filesusr.com/ugd/86a16f_1e25e5ac5db44fb7b7e4eb2fe845ce2d.pdf):

_Chainweb is a new parallel-chain Proof-of-Work architecture comprised of
braided chains that all mine the same native currency and transfer liquidity
between each other. Unlike existing Proof-of-Work architectures, Chainweb offers
massive throughput without significantly increasing hash power. Chainweb has the
potential to grow to at least 1,250 chains executing upwards of 10,000
transactions per second while still maintaining the unmatched resilience against
fraud and censorship of Proof of Work_

Chainweb also helps to democratize mining. On Kadena’s multichain proof of work
system, individual miners earn mining rewards just as often as they would if
they were mining as part of a pool on Bitcoin’s proof of work.

## 3. Mining On Kadena

A miner’s reward in a single-chain environment varies. One may only mine a block
once per year, which is not sustainable from a profit/loss perspective. In a
multi-chain system such as Kadena’s, miners earn several blocks per month.

Mining Kadena is easy — all you need is the hardware. Turn on the machine, put
in an address, and point it at a node or a pool to start earning KDA on the only
network with truly decentralized proof of work mining.

Block rewards are readjusted against a set schedule every six months.
Approximately half of the remaining minable coins are issued as block rewards
for 20 years. Kadena is mineable for approximately 120 years.

## The bottom line: Kadena is the blockchain for builders

Pact, Chainweb, and easier mining are just the tip of the iceberg as to what’s
ahead for the future of blockchain, thanks to Kadena. Follow us and you’ll learn
why!
