# Pact 2.3.8 is out!

The latest version of Kadena’s smart-contract language, Pact 2.3.8, is released!
This update boasts auto-completion and full readline support for the pact
command line interpreter, no more rlwrap required. Hit tab to see all
completions, up-arrow and down-arrow for history, Ctrl-A for beginning of line,
Ctrl-E for end, etc. All made possible in record time by the incomparable Joel
Burget.

Also community member Konrad Scorciapino (“konr” on github) made heroic docs
updates. Remember, in a LISP the docs follow the code, don’t forget you can get
full docs on a function right from the interpreter and not scramble for the
[language reference](/reference)! Here’s konr’s corrected docs for
with-read-default:

```pact
    pact> with-default-read
    (TNative with-default-read (table:table:<{row}> key:string defaults:object:<{row}> bindings:binding:<{row}> -> <a>) Special form to read row from TABLE for KEY and bind columns per BINDINGS over subsequent body statements. If row not found, read columns from DEFAULTS, an object with matching key names. `$(with-default-read 'accounts id { "balance": 0, "ccy": "USD" } { "balance":= bal, "ccy":= ccy }
       (format "Balance for {} is {} {}" [id bal ccy]))`)
```
