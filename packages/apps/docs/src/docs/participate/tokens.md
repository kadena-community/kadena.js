# What are Kadena tokens? 

The native Kadena token is listed on exchanges as KDA.
KDA is a digital currency that is used to pay for the resources used to process transaction on the Kadena public blockchain. 
Similar to ETH on Ethereum, users pay transaction fees to have their transactions included in a block using KDA.
KDA is also used to compensate the node operators—often referred to as miners—for validating transactions and adding blocks to the network.

The *Kadena Token Economic Model* describes the total token supply, how tokens are allocated, how tokens reserved for the platform can be used, and how the measured release of allocated tokens supports stability and growth.
