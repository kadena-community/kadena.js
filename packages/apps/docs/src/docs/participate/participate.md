# Support the community

There are many ways to become an active participant in the Kadena community.
For example, you can join the conversation on Discord, ask and answer questions on Stack Overflow, or attend Kadena events at conferences. 
There are also ways you can contribute to the community by providing feedback about projects in progress or suggesting changes to documentation or the codebase. 
This part of the documentation highlights how you can get involved and where to find more information about community programs, developer programs, grants, partnerships, business development, and ecosystem opportunities, if youâ€™re interested.

## Contribute to the codebase

The Kadena codebase is open source and hosted on GitHub in repositories under two organizations: [kadena-io](https://github.com/kadena-io) and [kadena-community](https://github.com/kadena-community).

- Repositories in [kadena-io](https://github.com/kadena-io) are focused on the Kadena network infrastructure and foundational components like [chainweb-node](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node) and [pact](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact).

- Repositories in [kadena-community](https://github.com/kadena-community) are focused on tooling and projects to help developers build applications on the Kadena network like the TypeScript libraries in [kadena.js](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js).

For more information about contributing to the codebase, you should browse the repositories and corresponding README files.
