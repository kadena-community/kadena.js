## Introduction to Pact

Pact is an open-source programming language for writing **smart contracts**.

It’s designed from the ground up to support the unique challenges of developing
solutions to run on a blockchain. Pact empowers developers to create robust and
high-performance logic for transactions. It facilitates execution of
mission-critical business operations quickly and effectively.

Pact is designed with safety in mind. Its design is informed by existing
approaches to smart contracts as well as stored procedure languages like SQL and
LISP. Pact resembles a general-purpose, Turing-complete language. It includes
LISP-like syntax, user functions, modules, and imperative style.

### Pact Smart Contracts

Pact smart contracts contain three core elements: the code module, keysets, and
tables.

The table below briefly introduces each of these core elements.

|             |                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Module**  | A module defines the logic of a smart contract. It contains functions, pact definitions, tables, and schemas.                                      |
| **Keysets** | Includes relevant documentation links and allows you to load code into the REPL, refresh the REPL, or deploy smart contract.                       |
| **Tables**  | Tables store data generated by Pact modules. These tables have a “key-row” structure and support schemas as well as a versioned, columnar history. |

Each of these elements support a wide range of functionality. This ensures that
you have the tools you need to create robust solutions for real-world problems.

## Pact Key Features

There are many valuable features make Pact such a safe and high-performance
language. Here are a few that we’ll focus on throughout this tutorial.

**Pact Key Features**

- Turing Incomplete
- Human Readable
- Upgradable Contracts
- Formal Verification
- Type Inference
- Total Governance
- RDBMS Integration
- Pacts

### Turing Incomplete

Pact contracts are Turing incomplete.

A Turing complete language has the power to run any possible program. In some
languages, Turing completeness is an extremely important feature. For smart
contracts, it’s an incredibly dangerous feature. For that reason, Pact is
designed to be Turing incomplete which places deliberate constraints on its
computational ability. This supports its design goal of “just enough” power for
transactional blockchain solutions and helps ensure the security of its smart
contracts.

The first restriction in Pact is that there is no unbounded looping or
recursion. Pact detects recursion and fails immediately. Looping is also only
supported in special circumstances. The key benefits of this are to reduce cost
and improve performance. This feature makes some of the most infamous and costly
bugs discovered in other platforms not even possible with Pact. For more
information on this topic, see our blog post -

[Turing Completeness and Smart Contract Security](/blogchain/2019/turing-completeness-and-smart-contract-security-2019-02-11)

### Human Readable

Pact smart contracts are human readable.

All Pact code gets stored as written in a **human-readable** form on the ledger.
Pact smart contracts install directly onto the blockchain. This allows you to
review the running code as it was written and be sure of exactly what it's
doing.

This is important because smart contracts solve business problems that require
both technical and non-technical expertise. Building the best smart contract
solution requires everyone to understand and contribute to the development of
the smart contract.

For that reason, Pact was built to be simple to read and write. This simplicity
helps provide complete transparency for the logic within its smart contracts.
This approach also encourages shorter programs. The code executes directly on
the ledger where it can be read easily by anyone. As a result, Pact is easy to
understand.

For example, here’s a “Hello World” smart contract using Pact.

```pact title=" "

(module helloWorld 'admin-keyset
  (defun hello (name)
    (format "Hello {}!" [name]))
)
(hello "world")

```

Without having learned anything about the Pact language, you can already start
to see how it works. With these few simple lines of code, you see a fully
functioning Pact “Hello World” smart contract.

Once written, smart contracts are deployed to a blockchain. In Pact, the code on
the blockchain is the same as the code that was written. Maintaining this code
means that no matter when you see the code it will always be as it was written.
This allows you to understand the code so you can continue to moderate and
improve your application over time.

### Upgradable Contracts

Pact contracts are upgradable.

Upgradable contracts allow you to revise and improve your smart contracts over
time. This allows you to offer new features and fix bugs as you continue
developing your smart contract. None of this is possible with other smart
contract languages, and it’s a powerful feature when building impactful
applications for your business.

Pact's tooling ecosystem further amplifies the simplicity of upgrading
contracts. Compiler and runtime errors offer detailed information, with stack
traces and function documentation to ensure you’re making the best version of
your smart contract.

Pact’s iterative development process is also supported by a feature-rich REPL
helping you to improve and deploy new smart contracts rapidly. It includes
features such as incremental transaction execution and environment and database
inspection.

### Formal Verification

Pact comes equipped with a powerful validation tool suite in the form of

> [formal verification](/blogchain/2018/pact-formal-verification-for-blockchain-smart-contracts-done-right-2018-05-11).
> Pact uses Z3, an open-source tool developed by Microsoft, to mathematically
> verify and test for bugs present in the code.

This means that Pact allows smart contract authors to express, automatically
check, and formally verify that their code does not contain any bugs. Formal
verification is the same system used to protect mission-critical environments
like nuclear power plants or air and space autopilot systems. You now have this
same high level of security in every smart contract you write with Pact.

Formal verification is a huge topic that’s been covered well in the Kadena blog.

for more information on this topic.

### Type Inference

Pact includes type inference.

This feature makes it possible for code to be strongly-typed without declaring
type information. It also has the added benefit of limiting run-time type
enforcement. Developers can use a typecheck to add “just enough types”.
Typecheck eliminates warnings and only enforces types at runtime where needed.

### Total Governance

Similar to RDBMS systems, Pact offers the benefit of total governance. This
benefit allows changes to commit to the database only if the code runs
successfully. Any errors roll back changes, abort execution, and avoid costly
mistakes.

### RDBMS Integration

Pact is also designed to allow direct integration with an industrial RDBMS. This
design is helpful in cases that need efficient publication of historical data.

### Confidential Computing with “Pacts”

The Pact programming language comes from one of its key features, known as
“Pacts”. “Pacts” solve a significant blockchain problem in privacy-preserving
blockchains. To maintain privacy on a blockchain, participants can only run a
subset of smart contracts. In these cases, the databases of each of the
participants become disjointed.

Pact solves this problem using coroutines. Coroutines are functions that can
start and stop at critical points in a function’s execution. These coroutines
are called pacts. They define the steps to be executed by different entities as
sequential transactions on the blockchain.
