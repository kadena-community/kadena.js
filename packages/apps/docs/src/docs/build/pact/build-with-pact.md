# Build with Pact

Pact is a human-readable smart contract programming language. 
It allows anyone to write clearly, directly, and safely onto a blockchainâ€”a true innovation for secure and simple smart contract development. 
With Pact, you can create new business models and on-chain services that execute efficiently on the scalable Kadena network.

To learn Pact, you can follow the documentation to start with fundamental concepts and simple examples to illustrate common activities.
After covering the basics, the documentation provides examples and how-to guides for using the language in realistic scenarios.

For complete reference information for the Pact smart contract programming language, see [Smart contracts: Pact programming language](/reference/pact-ref).

## Using the documentation


## More resources for learning Pact

- [Deploy your first contract - Quick start](/build/quickstart) introduces blockchain and Kadena concepts for new developers using a simple "Hello, World!" smart contract you can deploy on a local development network.
- [Pact local queries](/build/guides/pact-local-api-queries) demonstrate how to use local Chainweb API endpoints to test smart contracts using Mainnet data (community contribution).
- [Deploy a module to the Kadena test network using command line](https://gist.github.com/LindaOrtega/1c219f887d9782c6745dbd827bdbfb4d) (example): (Community contribution)

After you're comfortable with the basics of the language, you should explore [Real World Pact](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/real-world-pact) tutorials and commented Pact code to learn how to write real-world smart contracts including a testnet faucet and a DeFi lending platform.
