# Build with kadena-cli

The Kadena command-line interface (`kadena-cli`) provides direct access to the Kadena blockchain and to commands that help you create, test, deploy, and manage applications for the Kadena network.
You can use the Kadena command-line interface to perform tasks interactively or in scripts and automated workflows that don't allow interactive input.

The Kadena CLI has one primary entry point‚Äîthe `kadena` parent command. 
By providing a single entry point for performing a wide range of tasks, the Kadena CLI integrates naturally into the typical development workflow.
With commands designed specifically for building, testing, and managing Kadena-based applications, you can focus on building innovative applications using familiar tools.

## Before you begin

Before you use the Kadena command-line interface, verify the following basic requirements:

- You have `node`, version 18 or later, installed.

- You have the `pnpm` package manager installed.
  
  Depending on your development environment, you can install pnpm using a standalone script or using a package manager. For example, you can run the command `brew install pnpm` or `npm install --global pnpm` to install pnpm on your local computer. For more information about installing pnpm on different operating systems, see Installation.
  
  Run `pnpm --version` to verify that you have pnpm installed and the version you are running.

## Install

The Kadena CLI is packaged in a TypeScript library that you can install using a package manager such as `npm` or `pnpm`.

To install globally using `npm` package manager, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @kadena/kadena-cli
```

To install globally using `pnpm` package manager, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install -g @kadena/kadena-cli
```

To verify the package is installed and display usage information, type `kadena` and press Return:

```bash
kadena
```

To see the version of the package you have installed, run the following command:

```bash
kadena version
```

## Get started

The `kadena-cli` package is designed to streamline the development workflow with commands that provide direct
access to everything you need to build on and interact with Kadena networks.
Whether you're doing local development, deploying an application on the test network, or managing your accounts and keys on the Kadena main network, you can use the `kadena-cli` commands to complete tasks without leaving your development environment.

The following diagram provides an overview of the `kadena` command-line interface:

![Kadena command-line interface at a glance](/assets/docs/kadena-cli-overview.png)

## Prepare a development workspace

You can use the `kadena` entry point to run commands that help you set up a complete local development environment.
You can use the command-line interface to generate random keys, create local wallets, add accounts, customize network connections, and construct and send transactions.
After you prepare a development workspace, you can use `kadena` CLI commands in combination with other tools‚Äîlike Pact and Kadena client‚Äîto create, test, deploy, and manage decentralized applications for the Kadena network.

## Start with interactive prompting

The `kadena-cli` package is designed to simplify setting up a development environment.
Its intuitive commands prompt you for all of the information required to complete tasks, like creating accounts or managing keys.
Responding to prompts interactively is typically the best approach when getting started, eliminating the need to look up or remember the arguments required for the action you want to perform.

To start using the CLI in interactive Mode, you simply type _kadena_ followed by a _subject_ that describes the type of information you want to work with and a _verb_ to describe what you want to do.
You don't need to specify any additional arguments or options.

For example, if you want to add a new wallet but aren't sure of all the required flags and
arguments, you can start by entering the following command:

```
kadena wallet add
```

The CLI then displays interactive prompts, asking for the information required to successfully complete the task at hand‚Äîin this example, adding the wallet to your local development environment.
As you gain experience, you can reduce interactive prompting by specifying some or all of the arguments as part of the command. 
If you run any command without specifying all of its required parameters, the CLI prompts you to provide the missing information. 

## Configure initial settings

After installing the `kadena-cli` package, the first step for working with the Kadena command-line interface is to use `kadena config init` to create a configuration folder to store information about your development environment and connecting to Kadena networks. 
Depending on where you want the configuration settings available for your projects to use, you can create the configuration folder in a **working directory** or in your **home directory**.

By default, a Kadena configuration folder named `.kadena` is created in your current working directory.
The settings in the folder are then available to projects within that directory. 
For example, if you run `kadena config init` with `$HOME/projects/my-kadena-project` as your current working folder, you can access the `.kadena`
configuration settings from anywhere inside the `my-kadena-project` project folder.
Creating the configuration folder in a working directory enables you to have different configuration settings for different projects.

If you want to use the same configuration settings from any folder on your computer, you can create a global configuration folder in your home directory by running the `kadena config init --global` command. The `--global` command-line option adds the `kadena` configuration folder to the `.config` folder in your home directory so that the settings are available globally on your computer. 

Configuration settings that are defined in a local working directory take precedence over configuration settings defined in the home directory. 
If you add more than one configuration folder to your development environment, you can use `kadena config path` to see which path is being used in a specific directory.

To configure initial settings:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena config init` on the command line to create the configuration folder interactively:
   
   ```bash
   kadena config init
   ```
   
   This command creates the `.kadena` configuration folder location is your current working directory confirmed and adds default network settings to a `networks` subfolder, then prompts you to create a wallet.
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   Created configuration directory:
   
   /Users/pistolas/MY-KADENA/.kadena
   
   Added default networks:
     
     - mainnet
     - testnet
     - devnet
     ? Would you like to create a wallet? (Use arrow keys)
     ‚ùØ Yes
       No
   ```

   If you already have keys and an account or an existing wallet that you want to use, you can select **No** to end the interactive session.
   However, wallets are an important part of interacting with any blockchain, so you can create one now as part of your initial configuration steps.

1. Select **Yes** and press Return to continue setting up your local development environment.
1. Enter a wallet name and press Return.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Enter your wallet name: pistolas
   ```

2. Enter and confirm a password for the wallet to generate a public and secret key pair.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Enter the new wallet password: ********
   ? Re-enter the password: ********
   ```

   After entering the password, you are prompted to create an account using the wallet key generated for your first wallet.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Create an account using the first wallet key? (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ Yes
     No
   ```

3. Select **Yes** to continue setting up your local development environment with a local account.
4. Enter an alias for the local account and press Return.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Enter an alias for an account: pistolas-kda
   ```

   The command automatically creates a local Kadena principal account and displays information about your account and wallet.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ====================================================
   == üö® IMPORTANT: Mnemonic Phrase üö® ==
   ====================================================
   Mnemonic Phrase:
   upset crater alien galaxy humble appear prize all glove globe music number
   
   Please store the mnemonic phrase in a SAFE and SECURE place. 
   This phrase is the KEY to recover your wallet. Losing it means losing access to your assets.
   
   ====================================================
   
   First keypair generated
   publicKey: 61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546
   
   Wallet Storage Location
   .kadena/wallets/pistolas.yaml
   
   Account created
   accountName: k:61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546
   
   Account Storage Location
   .kadena/accounts/pistolas-kda.yaml
   
   Executed:
   kadena config init --create-wallet="true" --wallet-name="pistolas" --create-account="true" --account-alias="pistolas-kda" 
   ```

   Be sure to copy and store the mnemonic phrase in a safe place. 
   This 12-word secret phrase is required if you ever need to recover your wallet.

You now have a public key that you can use to sign transactions and authorize certain activity.
In this example, the public key for the wallet is 61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546.
You also have the principal account associated with the key.
In this example, the principal **account name** is k:61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546.

For more information about accounts names, keys, and principal accounts, see [Accounts, keys, and principals](/learn/accounts).

## View wallet and account information

At this point, you have one public and secret key pair, a local wallet, and a local account.
However, this information isn't associated with a specific network‚Äîdevnet, testnet, or mainnet‚Äîor with any chain identifier (0-19).
Before you add the account to a specific network and chain, you might want to verify the information you have defined so far to understand the current state of your development environment.

### View wallet information

To view information about the wallet:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena wallet list` on the command line to list wallet information interactively:
   
   ```bash
   kadena wallet list
   ```

  This command prompts you to select a wallet.
  For example:

  ```bash
  ? Select a wallet: (Use arrow keys)
  ‚ùØ All Wallets
    pistolas
  ```

1. Select **All Wallets**, then press Return.

   If have only one wallet, you should see output similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   Wallet: pistolas
   Alias Index Public key                                                      
   N/A   0     61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546

   Executed:
   kadena wallet list --wallet-name="all" 
   ```

### View account information

To view information about the account:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena account list` on the command line to list account information interactively:
   
   ```bash
   kadena account list
   ```

  This command prompts you to select an account.
  For example:

  ```bash
  ? Select an account (alias - account name): (Use arrow keys)
  ‚ùØ All accounts
    pistolas-kda      - k:61cf22....6c355546
  ```

1. Select **All accounts**, then press Return.

   If have only one account, you should see output similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   Alias        Name                             Public Key(s)            Predicate Fungible
   pistolas-kda k:61cf22aa8f20....7743bf6c355546 61cf22aa8f....bf6c355546 keys-all  coin    
   
   Executed:
   kadena account list --account-alias="all" 
   ```

   Note that the account name k:61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546, shortened to k:61cf22aa8f20....7743bf6c355546 uses the default **keys-all** predicate and the fungible for the account is **coin**.
   The **keys-all** predicate is a **guard**.
   Guards define the condition that must be satisfied for an operation to proceed. 
   In this case, all public keys associated with the k:61cf22aa8f209b1a5549242601b4a217f034e3d931b6522ccb7743bf6c355546 account must sign transactions.

   The first wallet and default account information provide you with the basics for signing transactions: a public key, an account name, and a predicate.
   However, there aren't many practical applications that involve signing transactions using a local account. 
   Before you can use an account to send and receive funds and sign the most common types of transactions, it must exist on a network and have funds on one or more chains.

## Fund your first onchain account

To create an account on the Kadena main network, you need to either have KDA already or know someone who can transfer funds to your account for you.
However, for local development or development on the Kadena test network, you can fund your account using `kadena account` commands, a faucet application, or publicly available private keys.

If you created a local wallet and an account using the wallet key, you can use that information to add your account to the development or test network on one or more chains.

To fund an onchain account:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena account fund` on the command line to fund an account interactively:
   
   ```bash
   kadena account fund
   ```

1. Select the account alias you used for your first account.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Select an account (alias - account name): (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ pistolas-kda      - k:61cf22....6c355546
   ```

1. Enter an amount, then press Return.
2. For example:

   ```bash
   ? Enter an amount: 2
   ```

1. Select a network, then press Return.
   For example, enter **devnet** to make this account available on the local development network:

   ```bash
   ? Select a network: (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ devnet
     testnet
   ```

2. Select one or more chain identifiers, then press Return.
   For example, enter **all**:

   ```bash
   ? Enter a ChainId (0-19) (comma or hyphen separated e.g 0,1,2 or 1-5 or all): all
   ```

   If prompted to deploy the faucet module on the network, select **Yes**.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Do you wish to deploy faucet module? (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ Yes
     No
   ```
   
   If you selected all chains and are deploying the faucet module, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Deployed faucet module on chain "18, 0, 7, 12, 4, 3, 1, 6, 11, 10, 13, 9, 14, 5, 16, 15, 2, 8, 19, 17" in "devnet" network.

   Use "kadena account details" command to check the balance.
   
   Executed:
   kadena account fund --account="pistolas-kda" --amount="2" --network="devnet" --chain-ids="all" --deployFaucet 
   ```

1. Verify account information for the account for a subset of by chains.
   For example, to see account details for chains 1, 2, and 3 formatted as JSON output, you can specify command-line options similar to the following:
   
   ```bash
   kadena account details --account="pistolas-kda" --network="devnet" --chain-ids="1-3" --json
   ```

   This command displays output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Details of account "pistolas-kda" on network "development"

       }
     },
   ]   
   ```

2. Select the account alias you used for your first account.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? Select an account (alias - account name):
     Enter an account name manually:
   ‚ùØ pistolas-kda      - k:61cf22....6c355546
   ```

3. Select a network, then press Return.
   For example, enter **devnet** to make this account available on the local development network:

   ```bash
   ? Select a network: (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ devnet
     testnet
   ```

## Add your account to a network

To create an account on the Kadena main network, you need to either have KDA already or know someone who can transfer funds to your account for you.
However, for local development or development on the Kadena test network, you can fund your account using `kadena account` commands, a faucet application, or publicly available private keys.

If you created a local wallet and an account using the wallet key, you can use that information to add your account to the development or test network and one or more chains.

To add your account to the test network:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena account add` on the command line to enter account information interactively:
   
   ```shell
   kadena account add
   ```

   You can add an account to the network by specifying one or more public keys manually or you can use the information from your wallet to add your first account to a network.
   For example:

   ```bash
   ? How would you like to add the account locally? (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ Manually - Provide public keys to add to account manually
     Wallet - Provide public keys to add to account by selecting from a wallet
   ```

1. Select **Wallet**, then press Return.
2. Select a wallet name, then press Return.
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   ? Select a wallet: (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ Wallet: pistolas
   ```

## Transfer funds to the new account

## Fund the account

## Get account details

kadena account details
? Select an account:(alias - account name)
  Enter an account name manually:
‚ùØ pistolas      - k:592676....fee2c4b5

Select a network (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ devnet
  mainnet
  testnet

? Enter a ChainId (0-19) (comma or hyphen separated e.g 0,1,2 or 1-5 or all):

## Set a default network

Many commands require you to specify the network you want to work with.
You can streamline command execution by setting a default network.
For example, if you are just getting started, you might want to set the default network to `devnet` to save time as you iterate on your application.
Later, you might want to unset the default, so you can specify the network to use on a command-by-command basis.
As your application matures, you might want change the default network from `devnet` to `testnet` so you can deploy updates for broader testing.

To set the default network:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena network set-default` on the command line to set the default network interactively:

   ```shell
   kadena network set-default
   ```
   
   Because you're running the command interactively, you are prompted to select a network.
   For example:

   ? Select a network (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ devnet
     mainnet
     testnet

3. Use the up and down arrow keys to select the network you want to use as your default network, then press Return.
   For example, select **devnet**, then press Return.

4. Select **Yes** to confirm your default network, then press Return.
   
## Create a project

You can use the `kadena dapp`command to create a new project directory for the decentralized application you want to build.
This command allows you to create an empty project directory or to create a new project from one of the frontend framework templates that are currently supported.
You can create the new project using templates for the following frontend frameworks:

- [Nextjs][18]
- [Vuejs][19]
- [Angular][20]

To create a new project from a template:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you've installed the `kadena-cli` package.
2. Enter `kadena dapp create <app-name>` on the command line to create a new project directory with the name you specify.
   For example, to create a project names my-to-do:

   ```shell
   kadena dapp add my-to-do
   ```
   
   Because you're running the command interactively, you are prompted to select a template.
   For example:

   ```shell
   ? What template do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
   ‚ùØ Angular
     Next JS
     Vue JS
   ```
1. Use the up and down arrow keys to select the template to use for your project, then press Return.

   If you are missing required dependencies for the template you select, you are prompted to install them.

2. Confirm that you want to install missing dependencies.
   
1. Change to your project directory by running a command similar to the following:

```bash
cd my-vuejs
```

## Add a second set of keys

## Add a new account

## Add a transaction

### Examples

The `kadena tx add` command enables you to create transactions using **templates** in combination with values you specify to generate the most common types of transactions that are ready to sign and submit across multiple chains with minimal effort.
Currently, there are two default templates‚Äî`transfer` and `safe-transfer`‚Äîto enable to you create transactions that transfer tokens between accounts.
For more information about using templates to generate transactions, see [Code templates](/build/templates).
To generate a transaction from a template interactively, you can run the following command:

```bash
kadena tx add
```

This command then prompts you to select the template to use and information about the account to transfer from and the account to transfer to.

For example:

```bash
? Which template do you want to use: transfer.ktpl
? File path of data to use for template .json or .yaml (optional):
? Template value account-from:
k:bbccc99ec9eeed17d60159fbb88b09e30ec5e63226c34544e64e750ba424d35e
? Template value account-to:
k:bbccc99ec9eeed17d60159fbb88b09e30ec5e63226c34544e64e750ba424d35e
? Template value decimal-amount: 1.0
? Template value chain-id: 1
? Template value pk-from:
bbccc99ec9eeed17d60159fbb88b09e30ec5e63226c34544e64e750ba424d35e
? Template value network-id: testnet
? Where do you want to save the output: my-test-output
```

After you respond to the prompts, the command displays the transaction you constructed and confirms the location of the file containing the unsigned transaction.

To sign an unsigned transaction using a public and secret key pair, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
kadena tx sign --tx-sign-with="keyPair" --key-pairs="publicKey=xxx,secretKey=xxx" --tx-unsigned-transaction-files="transaction-(request-key).json"
```

To sign two unsigned transactions using a key alias file from a wallet, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
kadena sign --tx-sign-with="aliasFile" --wallet-name="mywallet.wallet" --key-alias-select="mywalletalias.key" --tx-unsigned-transaction-files="transaction-(request-key).json,transaction-(request-key).json"
```

You can use the `kadena tx test` command to use a local API endpoint to check whether a signed transaction for a specified network is viable without submitting the transaction. 
By using the local endpoints, you can dry-run smart contract code using data in the `coin` contract tables without paying transaction fees.

To test whether a signed transaction would be successful on the test network using the local endpoint, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
kadena tx test --network="testnet" --directory="./my-tx" --tx-signed-transaction-files="transaction-(request-key)-signed.json" --chain-id="1"
```

To send a signed transaction to the Kadena main network and test network, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
kadena tx send --tx-signed-transaction-files="transaction-I4WaMUwQZDxhaf2r2FZj0TQf7Zv1J5v45Yc2MYxPURU-signed.json" --tx-transaction-network "mainnet, testnet" --poll
```

To get the status of a transaction on the Kadena blockchain, you can run a command similar to the following:

```bash
kadena tx status --request-key="118mEpX1-6NpJT1kArsWIHHVtJaOERQOeEwNoouOSGU" --network="testnet" --chain-id="0"
```

This command returns the current status of the transaction identified by the
provided request key.

To monitor the status of a transaction until it is finalized, you can add the `--poll` option.
For example:

```bash
kadena tx status --request-key="118mEpX1-6NpJT1kArsWIHHVtJaOERQOeEwNoouOSGU" --network="testnet" --chain-id="0" --poll
```

This command checks the transaction status and continues to run until
the transaction is confirmed.
The default timeout for polling is 60 seconds, but it will attempt to keep
polling until confirmation is achieved.

## Run commands in automated scripts 

For most commands, responding to interactive prompts and confirmation messages helps to ensure that you provide all of the information necessary to successfully execute each command.
However, if you want to disable all interactive prompts and confirmation messages, you can use the `--quiet `flag.
The `--quiet` flag enables you to run commands in environments where interactive input is impractical, such as automated test suites and continuous integration (CI) pipelines. 

If you include the  `--quiet` flag in a command, the command suppresses all interactive prompts and skips all confirmation messages, so that each command can run uninterrupted without human intervention. 
Running commands using the  `--quiet` flag ensures that automated processes can run smoothly and efficiently, without manual input.
If you use the  `--quiet` flag for a command, you must include all required arguments in the command line.
