# Prepare your workspace

To get started with the NFT marketplace workshop, you first need to prepare a working environment with a blockchain node running locally and some accounts with keys and funds for testing purposes.

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Set up a development network on your local computer.
- Create and fund accounts for three roles:
  - A token creator.
  - A token owner and seller.
  - A token buyer.
