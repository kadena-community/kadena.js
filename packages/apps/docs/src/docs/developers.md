# Overview

Kadena Developer documentation is organized into three main content areas:

- The **Get started** portion of the documentation is all about learning to write smart contracts and build applications using the Pact smart contract programming language for the Kadena blockchain network.
  This part of the documentation provides explanations and examples that describe programming language features, introduce Pact-specific concepts and terminology, and expose common programming patterns to help you design and build robust and secure applications.
- The **Coding projects** portion of the documentation provides you with opportunities to apply the information covered in **Get started** topics to sample projects with hands-on coding challenges. 
- The **Reference** portion of the documentation provides complete reference information for the Pact programming language—including syntax, keywords, and built-in functions—and the command-line interfaces you can use to interact with Pact smart contracts and the Kadena blockchain in a development, test, or production environment.

## Get started learning Pact

The **Get started** content area begins with an introduction to smart contract development and how to navigate the documentation. 
The topics align loosely with the software development life cycle, moving from basic concepts and simple examples to more complex topics.
At a high level, topics are organized to cover the following stages the software development life cycle:

- Learn the fundamentals of the programming language.
- Build programs with common core components like functions and tables.
- Test and debug your code to verify and improve its functionality.
- Iterate and update code when changes are required.
- Integrate user experiences and frontend frameworks.
- Deploy smart contracts for further testing or into production.

## Coding projects

The **Coding projects** content area provides instructional material for working with the sample projects located in the `pact-coding-projects` repository.
The topics that correspond with the sample projects illustrate concepts in action and complement explanation topics with hands-on exercises and coding challenges. 
The projects themselves highlight common use cases that can be adapted to many scenarios or extended to address new use cases.

## Reference

The **Reference** content area is where you'll find the information you most frequently need to look up.
For example, the **Reference** content area contains the descriptions and examples for all of the Pact built-in functions.
In general, reference information is organized alphabetically and easiest to find by using Search.
