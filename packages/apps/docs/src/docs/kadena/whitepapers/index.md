# Whitepapers

Kadena has published several whitepapers detailing important aspects of the Chainweb protocol, the Pact smart contract language, and the Kadena public blockchain.
You can download these white papers from the main [Kadena](https://www.kadena.io/whitepapers) website.
For additional information not contained in the whitepapers, see the following related resources for Chainweb and Pact.

## Chainweb

Chainweb is a braided, parallelized proof-of-work consensus mechanism that improves throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and integrity found in Bitcoin.

In 2020, the Kadena public blockchain performed a live network expansion from 10 chains to 20 chains. 
This expansion doubled throughput, proving the network's ability to scale in production to meet ever-higher demand.
